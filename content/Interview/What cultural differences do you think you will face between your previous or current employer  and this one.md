In my current and previous roles at TCS and Principal Global, the culture has been very delivery-focused, with an emphasis on client satisfaction, technical excellence, and collaboration across distributed teams. From what I understand, Barclays also shares these values — particularly around accountability, teamwork, and innovation in technology — so I see a strong cultural alignment.

Where I expect to see a difference is in the scale and stakeholder environment. At Barclays, I would be part of a global financial institution where compliance, governance, and risk management are deeply embedded in the culture. That level of regulatory rigor and the exposure to global teams will be new for me, but I believe my background — working with financial clients, automating solutions for efficiency, and collaborating across teams — has prepared me well to adapt.

So, while the focus areas may differ slightly, the core skills of clear communication, ownership, and delivering value remain consistent, and I see the differences more as opportunities for growth rather than challenges.
