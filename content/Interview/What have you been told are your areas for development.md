One area for development that was identified for me earlier in my career was around presentation and stakeholder communication.

Situation/Task: At TCS, I was delivering technical work reliably, but during reviews and client demos, my manager pointed out that I was very focused on the technical details and not always tailoring my communication for business stakeholders.

Action: I took that feedback seriously. I started preparing for client demos by framing my updates in terms of business impact rather than just technical changes. More recently at Principal Global, I actively volunteered to present topics during knowledge-sharing sessions—for example, I did a session on AWS Lambda Power Tools at a Tech Leads meeting.

Result: This practice has made me much more confident in communicating with both technical and non-technical audiences. It’s helped me not only explain my work more clearly but also get buy-in for initiatives like AWS cost optimization, where I successfully presented the analysis to stakeholders.

So I’d say it’s still a skill I continue to refine, but it’s already developed into a strength that lets me bridge technical work with business outcomes.
