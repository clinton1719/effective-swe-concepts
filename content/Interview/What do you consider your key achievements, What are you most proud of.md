One of the achievements I’m most proud of in my current role at Principal Global Services was automating a manual process for updating office data in our digital Request for Proposal application. I built a custom Spring Boot application that could dynamically read and update lists, which significantly reduced manual effort and improved efficiency for the operations team. What I liked about this achievement was not just the technical solution, but the direct business impact.

Another highlight was when I designed and implemented a custom load testing service using Helidon, AWS ECS, Lambda, and SQS in a serverless, event-driven architecture. This gave the team an automated way to stress-test our applications, improving reliability and scalability before releases. It was a chance to think end-to-end and architect a system, not just code it.

I’m also particularly proud of a cost optimization initiative where I identified redundant AWS KMS keys and consolidated them, which cut cloud costs by around 60%. I didn’t just execute the fix — I presented my analysis to stakeholders and got buy-in, which built my confidence in driving technical decisions at a larger scale.

Earlier in my career at TCS, working with ICICI Prudential as a client, I delivered over 140 requirements including several microservices, and even helped migrate legacy systems to AWS. That experience gave me both technical grounding and exposure to how large-scale financial systems operate.

Across both roles, what I’m proud of is not just delivering code, but finding ways to make systems faster, cheaper, and more reliable, while also contributing to team knowledge-sharing.
