At Principal Global Services, I noticed our AWS costs were trending significantly higher than expected. On investigation, I found that we had multiple redundant KMS keys being used across environments. This wasn’t part of my assigned work, but I saw it as a problem that was impacting both cost and maintainability.”

Action:
“I took the initiative to deep-dive into the issue, analyzing our key usage across accounts. I designed a consolidation strategy to migrate to a single Customer Master Key without breaking existing integrations. Since this involved potential risk, I created a phased migration plan, tested it thoroughly, and presented the proposal to stakeholders to get buy-in. I also highlighted the long-term governance benefits.”

Result:
“As a result, we achieved a 60% reduction in AWS KMS costs, improved our overall security posture, and standardized our key management. The success of this project was recognized at a team level, and it gave me opportunities to present the solution in wider forums. What I took away from this was that leadership isn’t only about managing people—it’s about spotting opportunities, taking ownership, and influencing others to deliver business value.
