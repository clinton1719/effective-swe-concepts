If I were to join Barclays, I’d see my first three months as a mix of learning, integrating, and contributing.

First Month – Learn & Integrate:
I’d focus on understanding the Barclays technology stack, processes, and governance standards. Building relationships with my team, stakeholders, and business partners would also be a priority.

Second Month – Contribute in Delivery:
Once I’m comfortable, I’d aim to start contributing to deliverables — whether it’s taking ownership of small features, supporting ongoing initiatives, or helping with troubleshooting. I’d also look for areas where my past experience with AWS optimization and automation could add immediate value.

Third Month – Add Value Beyond Delivery:
By this stage, I’d want to go beyond assigned tasks — for example, identifying potential inefficiencies, proposing improvements, or leading a knowledge-sharing session, much like I’ve done in my current role. The goal would be to establish myself as someone who is reliable, proactive, and able to strengthen the team.
