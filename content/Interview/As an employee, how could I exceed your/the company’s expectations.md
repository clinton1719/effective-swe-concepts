To me, meeting expectations would mean delivering quality work on time. To exceed expectations, I’d look at how I can go a step further:

Proactive problem-solving: Not just completing assigned tasks, but identifying inefficiencies, risks, or opportunities for improvement — whether in performance, cost optimization, or automation — and proposing solutions.

Knowledge sharing: Actively contributing to team learning by sharing best practices, mentoring peers, or presenting useful tools and frameworks that can raise overall capability.

Business alignment: Always keeping the bigger picture in mind — ensuring my work supports Barclays’ priorities of resilience, compliance, and digital transformation, rather than just focusing on the technical piece.

In short, I’d aim to exceed expectations by being someone who not only delivers, but also helps the team and company move forward faster and smarter
