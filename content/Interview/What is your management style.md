I would describe my management style as collaborative and outcome-oriented. Even though I’m not in a formal managerial role yet, I believe in taking ownership, setting clear goals, and supporting the team to achieve them. For example, at Principal Global, I initiated a knowledge-sharing session on AWS Lambda Power Tools. My approach was to simplify a complex concept, encourage questions, and ensure everyone walked away with something practical to apply.

I also believe in being proactive — if I see inefficiencies, I don’t wait for someone to assign it, I step in to propose solutions, like when I consolidated duplicate KMS keys, which saved 60% in AWS costs.

So overall, my style is about combining technical depth with clear communication, encouraging collaboration, and making sure we’re aligned on delivering value to the business. I aspire to grow into a leadership role where I can continue this balance of technical contribution and enabling others.
