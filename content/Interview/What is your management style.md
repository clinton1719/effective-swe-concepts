I’m currently working as a Software Engineer at Principal Global Services, where I’ve been involved in building and maintaining enterprise applications with a focus on scalable, secure solutions. Over the last few years, I’ve gained strong hands-on experience in [Java / NodeJS / ReactJS], and worked on projects that required collaboration with global teams and direct interaction with business stakeholders.

Before this, I started my career at TCS, where I worked with ICICI Prudential as a client. That gave me a solid foundation in financial services technology—understanding both the technical challenges and the domain side of insurance and financial products.

Academically, I have a B.Tech in Computer Science, which gave me the core technical grounding to build my career.

At this stage, I’m looking for opportunities that give me more responsibility, exposure to end-to-end solution design, and the chance to grow my career further. Barclays stood out to me because of its strong presence in both financial services and technology, and the way it positions India as a global capability hub. I see it as a place where I can contribute meaningfully, while also learning and taking on bigger challenges.
