Barclays stood out to me because of its strong presence in both financial services and technology, and the way it positions India as a global capability hub. I see it as a place where I can contribute meaningfully, while also learning and taking on bigger challenges.

From what I’ve read and researched, Barclays has been focusing on areas like automation, cloud, cost optimization, and resiliency—exactly the kind of challenges I’ve tackled in my current role

At a personal level, I’m looking for a role where I can move beyond just delivering features, and instead take on end-to-end ownership and contribute to innovation at scale. Barclays’ culture of innovation and its global footprint make it the right environment for me to grow while adding value to the team.
