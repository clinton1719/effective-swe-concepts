I’d define success in this role on three levels.

Personally, success means ramping up quickly on Barclays’ systems, processes, and culture so I can become a reliable contributor within the first few months.

At the team level, it would mean being a dependable teammate — delivering high-quality code, automating where possible, sharing knowledge, and helping the team achieve sprint and project goals consistently.

From a business impact perspective, success means contributing to applications and services that are not only functional, but also scalable, cost-efficient, secure, and resilient — aligning with Barclays’ long-term objectives of digital transformation and operational excellence.

In short, success would be when I’m seen as someone who adds measurable value — technically, collaboratively, and strategically.
