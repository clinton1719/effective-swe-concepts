At Principal Global, we faced a critical production issue in one of our applications—the system was hitting third-party API rate limits, which caused intermittent failures for end users. This was escalated quickly, and there was pressure from stakeholders to find a fast resolution.”

Action:
“I led the investigation, working closely with both the internal team and the external API provider. Rather than applying a quick patch, I proposed and implemented an exponential backoff strategy to handle retries gracefully. This meant redesigning parts of the client logic, coordinating with QA to test edge cases under load, and keeping stakeholders informed with clear, non-technical updates so they understood the risk and the plan.”

Result:
“The change was deployed successfully, and since then we’ve had zero production issues related to rate limiting. Beyond resolving the incident, it also increased the team’s confidence in my ability to handle high-pressure situations. What I learned was the importance of balancing technical depth with clear communication, especially when dealing with critical incidents
