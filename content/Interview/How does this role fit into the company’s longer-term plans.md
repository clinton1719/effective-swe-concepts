From what I understand, Barclays is heavily focused on digital transformation, cloud adoption, operational resilience, and cost efficiency to remain competitive in the financial services industry while meeting strict regulatory requirements.

This role as a Software Engineer directly supports those long-term plans by ensuring the systems and applications we deliver are scalable, secure, and efficient. The work involves not just building features, but also driving automation, improving performance, and optimizing cloud usage — all of which align with Barclays’ long-term goals of modernizing infrastructure and improving customer and client experience.

In that sense, I see this role as part of the foundation that enables Barclays to innovate safely at scale, and I believe my background in AWS cost optimization, serverless architectures, and automation fits well into that vision.
