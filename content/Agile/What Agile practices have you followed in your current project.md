In my current project, we follow weekly sprints. Every Tuesday, we have sprint planning where stories are discussed, estimated, and prioritized. We track work on a Kanban board, moving items from To Do → In Progress → Done, which gives good visibility of progress. We also do daily stand-ups to sync up on progress and blockers, and retrospectives to improve our process. This helps us stay aligned and adapt quickly if requirements change.
