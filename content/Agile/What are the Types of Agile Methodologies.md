## üß≠ Overview

Agile is not a single framework ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **mindset** and a **set of principles** defined in the *Agile Manifesto*.  
Over time, several **methodologies** have been developed to implement Agile principles in different types of projects and teams.

Each Agile methodology shares the same **core values** ‚Äî iterative progress, collaboration, customer focus, and adaptability ‚Äî  
but they differ in **processes, artifacts, and team structure**.

## üöÄ Major Types of Agile Methodologies

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Scrum**

Scrum is the **most widely used Agile methodology**.  
It focuses on delivering software in small, time-boxed iterations called **Sprints** (usually 2‚Äì4 weeks).

#### üß© Key Concepts:
- **Roles:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.  
- **Artifacts:** Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment.  
- **Ceremonies:** Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-up, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.  
- **Goal:** Deliver a working product increment at the end of each sprint.  

#### ‚úÖ Why Use Scrum:
- Great for projects where **requirements evolve rapidly**.  
- Emphasizes **collaboration, accountability, and visibility**.  
- Encourages continuous feedback and process improvement.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Kanban**

Kanban is a **visual workflow management system** focused on **continuous delivery** rather than time-boxed iterations.

#### üß© Key Concepts:
- Uses a **Kanban board** with columns like *To Do*, *In Progress*, *Testing*, *Done*.  
- Teams limit *Work In Progress (WIP)* to avoid bottlenecks.  
- Promotes a **pull-based system**, where new tasks are pulled only when capacity is available.  

#### ‚úÖ Why Use Kanban:
- Best suited for teams with **continuous, incoming work** (e.g., operations, maintenance).  
- Provides **visual clarity** on progress and bottlenecks.  
- Increases **flow efficiency** and adaptability.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Extreme Programming (XP)**

XP focuses on **engineering excellence** and aims to improve **software quality** through disciplined development practices.

#### üß© Key Concepts:
- **Practices:** Test-Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Continuous Integration (CI), Refactoring, and Simple Design.  
- Encourages **frequent releases** and **customer feedback**.  
- High emphasis on **automated testing** and **code quality**.

#### ‚úÖ Why Use XP:
- Ideal for teams where **requirements change frequently**.  
- Ensures **robust, maintainable, and high-quality code**.  
- Promotes close collaboration between developers and customers.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Lean Software Development**

Derived from **Lean Manufacturing (Toyota Production System)**, Lean focuses on **eliminating waste** and **maximizing customer value**.

#### üß© Key Principles:
- Eliminate waste  
- Amplify learning  
- Deliver fast  
- Empower the team  
- Build quality in  
- Optimize the whole  

#### ‚úÖ Why Use Lean:
- Encourages **efficiency** and **value-driven delivery**.  
- Reduces unnecessary processes and delays.  
- Works well in organizations focused on **cost-effectiveness and productivity**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Crystal Methodology**

Crystal focuses on **people and interactions** rather than processes or tools.  
It recognizes that **every project is unique**, and teams should choose the best practices suited to their context.

#### üß© Key Concepts:
- Multiple variants like **Crystal Clear**, **Crystal Yellow**, **Crystal Orange** depending on team size and project criticality.  
- Prioritizes **communication, simplicity, and reflection**.  
- Promotes **frequent delivery** and **process adaptation**.  

#### ‚úÖ Why Use Crystal:
- Suited for **small, co-located teams**.  
- Flexible and lightweight ‚Äî less documentation, more collaboration.  
- Encourages **self-management and adaptability**.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)**

DSDM is one of the oldest Agile methods, emphasizing **full project lifecycle management**.

#### üß© Key Concepts:
- Based on **eight core principles**, including active user involvement and frequent delivery.  
- Uses **timeboxing**, **MoSCoW prioritization** (Must, Should, Could, Won‚Äôt).  
- Focuses on **business value and collaboration**.

#### ‚úÖ Why Use DSDM:
- Ideal for **enterprise-level projects** needing governance and structure.  
- Offers a **clear project management framework** within Agile.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature-Driven Development (FDD)**

FDD is a **model-driven** Agile method that focuses on **building and delivering features** in short iterations.

#### üß© Key Concepts:
- Divides work into small, functional features.  
- Follows five steps:  
  1. Develop an overall model  
  2. Build a feature list  
  3. Plan by feature  
  4. Design by feature  
  5. Build by feature  

#### ‚úÖ Why Use FDD:
- Works well for **large teams and complex systems**.  
- Focuses on **predictability, measurability, and documentation**.  
- Balances **agility with structured design**.
