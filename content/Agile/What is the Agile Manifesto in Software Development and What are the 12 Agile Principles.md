## 🧭 What is the Agile Manifesto?

The **Agile Manifesto** is a foundational document for **Agile Software Development**, published in **2001** by a group of 17 software developers who wanted to find a better way to build software compared to traditional, rigid, plan-driven methods like the **Waterfall model**.

It emphasizes **flexibility, collaboration, customer satisfaction, and iterative progress**, focusing more on people and results than on processes and tools.

## 🧩 The 4 Core Values of the Agile Manifesto

| Traditional Focus | Agile Focus |
|--------------------|--------------|
| **Processes and tools** | **Individuals and interactions** |
| **Comprehensive documentation** | **Working software** |
| **Contract negotiation** | **Customer collaboration** |
| **Following a plan** | **Responding to change** |

### 💡 In essence:
Agile values *people over paperwork, collaboration over contracts, and adaptability over rigid plans.*

## 🧱 The 12 Agile Principles (Explained)

Below are the 12 guiding principles behind the Agile Manifesto — each describing how teams should behave to embody Agile values.

### 1️⃣ **Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery**
> Deliver working software frequently so the customer sees value early and often.

**Why:** Reduces risk, builds trust, and ensures alignment with customer needs.

---

### 2️⃣ **Welcome changing requirements, even late in development**
> Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

**Why:** Markets evolve; the ability to adapt ensures relevance.

---

### 3️⃣ **Deliver working software frequently**
> Prefer shorter timescales (weeks rather than months).

**Why:** Frequent delivery ensures faster feedback and real progress visibility.

---

### 4️⃣ **Business people and developers must work together daily**
> Encourage direct, ongoing communication.

**Why:** Reduces miscommunication and aligns business goals with technical implementation.

---

### 5️⃣ **Build projects around motivated individuals**
> Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.

**Why:** Empowered teams produce better, faster results.

---

### 6️⃣ **Face-to-face conversation is the most effective form of communication**
> Even in distributed teams, prioritize real-time, direct communication (video calls, stand-ups).

**Why:** Faster decisions, fewer misunderstandings.

---

### 7️⃣ **Working software is the primary measure of progress**
> Code that runs and delivers business value is the only real output that matters.

**Why:** Documents and plans don’t deliver value—software does.

---

### 8️⃣ **Agile processes promote sustainable development**
> Teams should maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

**Why:** Avoid burnout and maintain long-term productivity.

---

### 9️⃣ **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design**
> Better design improves agility and reduces long-term cost.

**Why:** Poor design causes technical debt, slowing future work.

---

### 🔟 **Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential**
> Focus only on what adds value.

**Why:** Overengineering wastes time and increases complexity.

---

### 11️⃣ **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams**
> Teams closest to the work make the best decisions.

**Why:** Autonomy leads to innovation and ownership.

---

### 12️⃣ **At regular intervals, the team reflects and adjusts its behavior**
> Retrospectives are used to continuously improve.

**Why:** Learning and adapting make teams more effective over time.

## 🧠 Interview Insight

**Common Question:** “How do you apply Agile principles in your daily work?”  
**Good Answer:**  
> “We use Scrum with 2-week sprints. We conduct daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives to continuously improve. Our focus remains on delivering small, functional increments aligned with changing customer requirements.”
