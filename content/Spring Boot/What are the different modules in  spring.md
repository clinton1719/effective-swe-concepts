## Different Modules in Spring Framework

The Spring Framework is modular, meaning it is divided into several components (modules) that can be used independently or together depending on the applicationâ€™s needs.  

Here are the **main modules of Spring**:

---

### 1. **Core Container**
- **Spring Core**: Provides the fundamental part of the framework, including **Dependency Injection (DI)** and **Inversion of Control (IoC)**.
- **Spring Beans**: Manages bean configuration and lifecycle.
- **Spring Context**: Provides context information and access to objects, similar to JNDI registry.
- **Spring Expression Language (SpEL)**: A powerful expression language for querying and manipulating objects at runtime.

---

### 2. **Data Access/Integration**
- **JDBC Module**: Simplifies database access and error handling.
- **ORM Module**: Integration with ORM frameworks like Hibernate, JPA, iBatis.
- **JMS Module**: Messaging support for asynchronous communication.
- **Transactions Module**: Declarative transaction management.

---

### 3. **Web**
- **Web Module**: Basic web-oriented integration features, including multipart file upload and servlet listeners.
- **Web-MVC Module**: Implements the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern for building web applications.
- **Web-Portlet Module**: Provides the MVC implementation to be used in a portlet environment.

---

### 4. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**
- Supports separating cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transaction management from business logic.

---

### 5. **Instrumentation**
- Provides class instrumentation and classloader support.  
- Useful for server environments.

---

### 6. **Messaging**
- Provides support for STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) over WebSocket.  
- Helps build real-time applications.

---

### 7. **Test**
- Provides support for testing Spring components with JUnit/TestNG.  
- Includes utilities for mock objects, dependency injection in test cases, and integration testing.

## ðŸ‘‰ Interview Tip
- Always start by naming **Core, AOP, Data Access, Web, Messaging, and Test** as the main categories.  
- Mention that **Spring Boot** builds on top of these modules to simplify configuration and dependency management.
