## Overview
Java 8 (released in **March 2014**) was a landmark release in the history of Java.  
It introduced **functional programming concepts**, better collection APIs, new libraries, and improved date/time handling.  
The goal was to make Java **more concise, expressive, and modern**, addressing the limitations of Java 7 and aligning with trends from other programming languages.

## Key Features in Java 8

### 1. **Lambda Expressions**
- **What:** Enable you to write anonymous functions in a compact way.  
- **Why:** To bring functional programming to Java and reduce boilerplate code.  
- **Example:**
  ```java
  List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
  names.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name));
  ```

---

### 2. **Functional Interfaces**
- **What:** Interfaces with exactly **one abstract method** (SAM - Single Abstract Method).  
- **Why:** Allow Lambda expressions to be used as implementations.  
- **Examples:** `Runnable`, `Callable`, `Comparator`, or custom ones annotated with `@FunctionalInterface`.

---

### 3. **Streams API**
- **What:** A new abstraction for processing collections in a **declarative, pipeline style**.  
- **Why:** To simplify bulk operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing, without writing loops.  
- **Example:**
  ```java
  List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
  List<String> filtered = names.stream()
                               .filter(n -> n.startsWith("A"))
                               .toList();
  ```

---

### 4. **Default and Static Methods in Interfaces**
- **What:** Interfaces can now contain `default` and `static` methods with implementations.  
- **Why:** To evolve interfaces without breaking existing implementations.  
- **Example:**
  ```java
  interface Vehicle {
      default void start() {
          System.out.println("Starting vehicle...");
      }
  }
  ```

---

### 5. **Method References**
- **What:** Shorthand for calling methods via `::`.  
- **Why:** To make code more concise and readable.  
- **Example:**
  ```java
  names.forEach(System.out::println);
  ```

---

### 6. **Optional Class**
- **What:** A container object that may or may not contain a value.  
- **Why:** To reduce `NullPointerException` issues and encourage safer handling of missing values.  
- **Example:**
  ```java
  Optional<String> value = Optional.ofNullable(null);
  System.out.println(value.orElse("Default"));
  ```

---

### 7. **New Date and Time API (java.time)**
- **What:** New immutable classes like `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, and `ZonedDateTime`.  
- **Why:** Old `Date` and `Calendar` APIs were mutable and poorly designed.  
- **Example:**
  ```java
  LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
  LocalDate future = today.plusDays(10);
  ```

---

### 8. **Nashorn JavaScript Engine**
- **What:** A JavaScript runtime for running JS code inside Java applications.  
- **Why:** To provide better performance and replace the old Rhino engine.  
- **Example:**
  ```java
  ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("nashorn");
  engine.eval("print('Hello from JavaScript!')");
  ```

---

### 9. **CompletableFuture and Enhanced Concurrency APIs**
- **What:** A more powerful Future with async callbacks (`thenApply`, `thenAccept`).  
- **Why:** To make asynchronous programming easier and more expressive.  
- **Example:**
  ```java
  CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello")
                   .thenApply(str -> str + " World")
                   .thenAccept(System.out::println);
  ```
