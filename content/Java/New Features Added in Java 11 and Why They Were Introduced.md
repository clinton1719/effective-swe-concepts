## Overview
Java 11 (released in **September 2018**) is a **Long-Term Support (LTS)** release, following Java 8.  
It continued the modernization of Java started with Java 8 and 9 by adding **new language enhancements, APIs, performance improvements, and removal of legacy modules**.  
The main goal was to make Java **simpler, more efficient, and cloud-friendly**.

---

## Key Features in Java 11

### 1. **Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters**
- **What:** You can use `var` in lambda parameters.  
- **Why:** Improves readability and enables annotations on lambda parameters.  
- **Example:**
  ```java
  BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> add = (var x, var y) -> x + y;
  ```

---

### 2. **New String Methods**
- **What:** Java 11 added several utility methods in `String`.  
- **Why:** To simplify common operations.  
- **Examples:**
  ```java
  " ".isBlank();               // true
  "Hello\nWorld".lines().count(); // 2
  "Java".repeat(3);            // "JavaJavaJava"
  "  test  ".strip();          // "test"
  ```

---

### 3. **Files and I/O Enhancements**
- **What:** New methods in `Files` API.  
- **Why:** Easier file handling in modern applications.  
- **Examples:**
  ```java
  String content = Files.readString(Path.of("file.txt"));
  Files.writeString(Path.of("file.txt"), "Hello Java 11");
  ```

---

### 4. **HTTP Client (Standardized)**
- **What:** New `HttpClient` API in `java.net.http`.  
- **Why:** To replace old `HttpURLConnection` with a modern, reactive, and async HTTP client.  
- **Example:**
  ```java
  HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
  HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                                   .uri(URI.create("https://example.com"))
                                   .build();
  HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
  System.out.println(response.body());
  ```

---

### 5. **Nest-Based Access Control**
- **What:** Introduced new JVM features to allow **nested classes** to access each other’s private members directly.  
- **Why:** To remove the need for synthetic bridge methods. Improves performance and reflection handling.

---

### 6. **Running Java Files with `java` (without compilation)**
- **What:** You can run a `.java` file directly without explicit compilation.  
- **Why:** Simplifies scripting and small programs.  
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  java HelloWorld.java
  ```

---

### 7. **Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) [Experimental]**
- **What:** A scalable, low-latency garbage collector.  
- **Why:** Designed for applications requiring **very large heaps (multi-terabyte)** with **sub-millisecond pause times**.  
- **Use case:** Cloud apps, big data, and real-time systems.

---

### 8. **Flight Recorder**
- **What:** Low-overhead data collection tool integrated into the JVM.  
- **Why:** Helps developers and operators monitor and troubleshoot production systems.

---

### 9. **Deprecations and Removals**
- Removed:
  - **Java EE modules** (`java.xml.ws`, `java.xml.bind`, `java.activation`, `java.corba`).  
  - **Applet API** (deprecated for removal).  
- **Why:** To clean up legacy, unused APIs and slim down the JDK.

✅ **In short:** Java 11 modernized the JDK by adding quality-of-life features, a powerful HTTP client, and better garbage collection, while removing old baggage.  
It’s one of the most important releases after Java 8 due to its **LTS status** and major ecosystem adoption.
