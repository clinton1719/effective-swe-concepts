What I liked about this achievement was not just the technical solution, but the direct business impact.\r\n\r\nAnother highlight was when I designed and implemented a custom load testing service using Helidon, AWS ECS, Lambda, and SQS in a serverless, event-driven architecture. This gave the team an automated way to stress-test our applications, improving reliability and scalability before releases. It was a chance to think end-to-end and architect a system, not just code it.\r\n\r\nI’m also particularly proud of a cost optimization initiative where I identified redundant AWS KMS keys and consolidated them, which cut cloud costs by around 60%. I didn’t just execute the fix — I presented my analysis to stakeholders and got buy-in, which built my confidence in driving technical decisions at a larger scale.\r\n\r\nEarlier in my career at TCS, working with ICICI Prudential as a client, I delivered over 140 requirements including several microservices, and even helped migrate legacy systems to AWS. That experience gave me both technical grounding and exposure to how large-scale financial systems operate.\r\n\r\nAcross both roles, what I’m proud of is not just delivering code, but finding ways to make systems faster, cheaper, and more reliable, while also contributing to team knowledge-sharing.\r\n\r\n",

The answer is:\r\n\r\n✅ Abstract classes and interfaces both provide abstraction, but they differ in purpose, usage, and capabilities.\r\n\r\n# Key Differences:\r\n\r\n## Methods:\r\n\r\nAbstract class → Can have both abstract and concrete methods.\r\n\r\nInterface → Before Java 8, only abstract methods; from Java 8 onwards, can have default and static methods; from Java 9, private methods too.\r\n\r\n## Access Modifiers:\r\n\r\nAbstract class → Methods can have any access modifier (public, protected, private).\r\n\r\nInterface → All methods are implicitly public and abstract (except default, static, and private methods which have fixed modifiers).\r\n\r\n## Variables:\r\n\r\nAbstract class → Can have final, non-final, static, and non-static variables.\r\n\r\nInterface → Variables are always public static final (constants).\r\n\r\n## Inheritance:\r\n\r\nAbstract class → A class can extend only one abstract (or concrete) class because Java does not support multiple class inheritance.\r\n\r\nInterface → A class can implement multiple interfaces, achieving multiple inheritance of type.\r\n\r\n## Extensibility:\r\n\r\nAbstract class → Can extend another class (abstract or concrete) and implement multiple interfaces.\r\n\r\nInterface → Can only extend other interfaces, not classes.\r\n\r\n## Use-case:\r\n\r\nAbstract class → Used when classes share a common state or base implementation.\r\n\r\nInterface → Used to define a contract of behavior across unrelated classes.\r\n\r\n```\r\nExample:\r\nabstract class Animal {\r\n    String name;\r\n\r\n    Animal(String name) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    abstract void makeSound();\r\n\r\n    void sleep() {\r\n        System.out.println(name + \" is sleeping...\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface Pet {\r\n    void play();\r\n\r\n    default void feed() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Feeding the pet...\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Dog extends Animal implements Pet {\r\n    Dog(String name) {\r\n        super(name);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    void makeSound() {\r\n        System.out.println(name + \" barks!\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void play() {\r\n        System.out.println(name + \" is playing fetch!\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Dog d = new Dog(\"Buddy\");\r\n        d.makeSound();\r\n        d.sleep();\r\n        d.play();\r\n        d.feed();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\nBuddy barks!\r\nBuddy is sleeping...\r\nBuddy is playing fetch!\r\nFeeding the pet...\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterview Tip:\r\n\r\nEven though Java 8 introduced default and static methods in interfaces, the core difference still remains:\r\n\r\nA class can extend only one abstract class,\r\n\r\nBut it can implement multiple interfaces.\r\n\r\nThat’s why interfaces are preferred when you need multiple inheritance of behavior, while abstract classes are better suited when you need a shared base state and implementation.\r\n\r\nVersion-specific Notes:\r\n\r\nJava 7 and below → Interfaces could only have abstract methods and constants.\r\n\r\nJava 8 → Introduced default and static methods in interfaces.\r\n\r\nJava 9 → Added private methods in interfaces.\r\n\r\nThus, abstract classes and interfaces complement each other but serve different design purposes in Java.",

    "content": "\r\nYes — this is a common interview question, and the answer is:\r\n\r\n> ✅ **Yes, abstract classes in Java do have constructors.**  \r\nYou can define one explicitly, or Java will provide a default constructor if you don't.\r\n\r\n### Why does an abstract class need a constructor?\r\n\r\nEven though you **cannot instantiate** an abstract class directly, its constructor is still called **when a subclass is instantiated**. The constructor helps to **initialize data members** defined in the abstract class.\r\n\r\n### Important Concepts:\r\n\r\n- Constructors are used to initialize instance variables.\r\n- An abstract class **can have instance variables** (just like any class).\r\n- When a subclass extends an abstract class and is instantiated, the **abstract class constructor is executed first** via an implicit or explicit `super()` call.\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nabstract class Vehicle {\r\n    String type;\r\n\r\n    Vehicle(String type) {\r\n        this.type = type;\r\n        System.out.println(\"Vehicle constructor called: \" + type);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Car extends Vehicle {\r\n    Car() {\r\n        super(\"Car\");\r\n        System.out.println(\"Car constructor called\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Car c = new Car();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nVehicle constructor called: Car\r\nCar constructor called\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs shown above:\r\n- The abstract class `Vehicle` has a constructor.\r\n- When `Car` is instantiated, `Vehicle`'s constructor is called first using `super(\"Car\")`.\r\n\r\nThis demonstrates that **abstract class constructors participate in the object initialization chain**, just like constructors in concrete superclasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "content": "\r\nThe four fundamental pillars of OOP are:\r\n\r\n1. **Abstraction**  \r\n2. **Encapsulation**  \r\n3. **Inheritance**  \r\n4. **Polymorphism**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 1. Abstraction\r\n\r\n**Definition**: Abstraction is the process of hiding internal implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user.\r\n\r\n**Real-world examples**:\r\n- **TV Remote**: To turn on the TV, you press the power button — you don’t need to know how the internal circuits work or how infrared signals are transmitted.\r\n- **Car Gear**: You know what happens when you change gears, but the underlying mechanism is hidden from you. That technical detail is abstracted.\r\n\r\n**In Java**, abstraction can be achieved in two ways:\r\n- Using **abstract classes**\r\n- Using **interfaces**\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Abstract class example\r\nabstract class Animal {\r\n    abstract void makeSound();\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Dog extends Animal {\r\n    void makeSound() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Bark\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. Encapsulation\r\n\r\n**Definition**: Encapsulation is the process of binding data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit — typically a class. It is also used to restrict access to internal details using access modifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`).\r\n\r\nEncapsulation supports **data hiding** and helps in achieving **abstraction**.\r\n\r\n**Example**:  \r\nA Java Bean where all data members are private and are accessed via public getters/setters.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Person {\r\n    private String name;\r\n\r\n    public String getName() {\r\n        return name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setName(String name) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3. Inheritance\r\n\r\n**Definition**: Inheritance allows one class (child/subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent/superclass). This promotes **code reusability** and establishes a **parent-child relationship** between classes.\r\n\r\n> Java supports single inheritance through classes and multiple inheritance through interfaces.\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n```java\r\nclass Animal {\r\n    void eat() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"This animal eats food\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Dog extends Animal {\r\n    void bark() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"The dog barks\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 4. Polymorphism\r\n\r\n**Definition**: \"Poly\" means many, and \"morph\" means forms. Polymorphism allows objects or methods to take multiple forms.\r\n\r\nThere are **two types of polymorphism**:\r\n\r\n#### a) Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)\r\nOccurs when multiple methods have the same name but different parameters in the same class. The method to call is decided at **compile-time**.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass MathUtils {\r\n    int add(int a, int b) {\r\n        return a + b;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    double add(double a, double b) {\r\n        return a + b;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### b) Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)\r\nOccurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass. The method to call is determined at **runtime**.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Animal {\r\n    void sound() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Animal makes sound\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Cat extends Animal {\r\n    void sound() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Cat meows\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Summary Table\r\n\r\n| Pillar        | Key Concept                            | Java Support                         |\r\n|---------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\r\n| Abstraction   | Hide internal details, show only needed| Abstract classes, Interfaces         |\r\n| Encapsulation | Bind data & methods, restrict access   | Classes, Access Modifiers            |\r\n| Inheritance   | Reuse code via parent-child classes    | `extends`, Interfaces (`implements`) |\r\n| Polymorphism  | One name, many forms                   | Overloading & Overriding             |\r\n\r\n",

The answer is:\r\n\r\n✅ Choose an interface when you want to define a contract for unrelated classes, and choose an abstract class when you want to provide shared state or partial implementation.\r\n\r\n## When to Use an Abstract Class:\r\n\r\nWhen you want to provide default implementations for some methods while keeping others abstract.\r\n\r\nWhen subclasses need to share common state (fields).\r\n\r\nWhen new methods are expected to be added frequently — because you can provide a default implementation in the abstract class without breaking existing subclasses.\r\n\r\nExample: AbstractList in Java Collections Framework provides skeletal implementations that subclasses can reuse.\r\n\r\n## When to Use an Interface:\r\n\r\nWhen you want to define a contract that multiple, potentially unrelated, classes can implement.\r\n\r\nWhen you need multiple inheritance of type (since a class can implement multiple interfaces but extend only one class).\r\n\r\nWhen you are designing APIs that should be flexible and loosely coupled.\r\n\r\nExample: List, Set, and Queue interfaces define behaviors that can be implemented by many classes.\r\n\r\n## Java 8+ Consideration:\r\n\r\nFrom Java 8 onwards, interfaces can have default and static methods, which makes them slightly closer to abstract classes. However:\r\n\r\nInterfaces still cannot have instance fields.\r\n\r\nAbstract classes are better if you need to share stateful logic.\r\n\r\nInterfaces remain the go-to choice when you need polymorphism across unrelated types.\r\n\r\n## Best Practice:\r\n\r\nPrefer interfaces when in doubt, especially for API design.\r\n\r\nUse abstract classes only when you need state + partial implementation.\r\n\r\n```\r\nExample:\r\ninterface Drivable {\r\n    void drive();\r\n\r\n    default void service() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Default vehicle service.\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nabstract class Vehicle {\r\n    String name;\r\n\r\n    Vehicle(String name) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void fuelUp() {\r\n        System.out.println(name + \" is refueling...\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    abstract void honk();\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Car extends Vehicle implements Drivable {\r\n    Car(String name) {\r\n        super(name);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    void honk() {\r\n        System.out.println(name + \" says: Beep beep!\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void drive() {\r\n        System.out.println(name + \" is driving...\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Car car = new Car(\"Tesla\");\r\n        car.drive();\r\n        car.service();\r\n        car.fuelUp();\r\n        car.honk();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\nTesla is driving...\r\nDefault vehicle service.\r\nTesla is refueling...\r\nTesla says: Beep beep!\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterview Tip:\r\n\r\nUse abstract class if you need to share state or provide default implementation for evolving behavior.\r\n\r\nUse interface when you need a clean contract and multiple inheritance.\r\n\r\nEven after Java 8’s default methods, the main distinction remains:\r\n\r\nInterfaces define contracts.\r\n\r\nAbstract classes provide base implementations and state.\r\n",

The answer is:\r\n\r\n✅ Default methods were introduced in Java 8 to allow interfaces to evolve without breaking existing implementations.\r\n\r\n## Why Were Default Methods Introduced?\r\n\r\nBefore Java 8, all interface methods were abstract.\r\n\r\nIf you added a new method to an interface, every implementing class (possibly hundreds of them) would break because they had to implement the new method.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, Java 8 introduced default methods where you can provide a method body directly in the interface.\r\n\r\nThis means existing classes can continue working unchanged, while still gaining new functionality if they want.\r\n\r\n## Key Benefits:\r\n\r\nAllows backward compatibility of interfaces.\r\n\r\nProvides default implementation so implementing classes are not forced to override.\r\n\r\nClasses can still override default methods if they want to customize behavior.\r\n\r\n```\r\nExample:\r\ninterface Vehicle {\r\n    void drive();\r\n\r\n    default void honk() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Default honk: Beep beep!\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Car implements Vehicle {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void drive() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Car is driving...\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Vehicle v = new Car();\r\n        v.drive();\r\n        v.honk(); // uses default implementation\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\nCar is driving...\r\nDefault honk: Beep beep!\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The Diamond Problem Scenario:\r\n\r\nIf a class implements two interfaces with the same default method, Java forces you to resolve the conflict:\r\n\r\ninterface Interface1 {\r\n    default void hello() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hello from Interface1\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface Interface2 {\r\n    default void hello() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hello from Interface2\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass MyClass implements Interface1, Interface2 {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void hello() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hello from MyClass (resolving conflict)\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\nHello from MyClass (resolving conflict)\r\n\r\nImportant Point for Interviews:\r\n\r\nDefault methods were introduced for backward compatibility, not as a replacement for abstract classes.\r\n\r\nIf two interfaces have the same default method, the implementing class must override it to resolve ambiguity (avoiding the Diamond Problem).\r\n\r\nThus, Java 8 default methods strike a balance between flexibility and backward compatibility while still maintaining clarity in multiple inheritance scenarios.\r\n",

The answer is:\r\n\r\n> ✅ **Java does not allow multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity and complexity (commonly known as the Diamond Problem).**\r\n\r\n## What is Multiple Inheritance?\r\n\r\n- Multiple inheritance occurs when a class tries to extend **more than one parent class**.  \r\n- Example (hypothetical, not allowed in Java):\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Parent1 {\r\n    void hello() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hello from Parent1\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Parent2 {\r\n    void hello() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hello from Parent2\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ❌ Not allowed in Java\r\nclass Child extends Parent1, Parent2 { }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Why is it Not Allowed?\r\n\r\n- If both parent classes have a method with the **same signature** (e.g., `hello()`), and the child inherits from both, **which method should the child call?**  \r\n- This leads to **ambiguity** and is referred to as the **Diamond Problem**.  \r\n- To keep the language **simple, clear, and less error-prone**, Java designers disallowed multiple class inheritance.\r\n\r\n## How Does Java Handle It Instead?\r\n\r\n- Java allows a class to **extend only one class** (abstract or concrete).  \r\n- To achieve multiple inheritance of type (behavior), Java uses **interfaces**.  \r\n- Since **Java 8**, interfaces can have `default` methods, but if a class implements two interfaces with the same default method, the compiler forces the developer to **override** it, thereby resolving the ambiguity explicitly.\r\n\r\n## Example with Interfaces (Allowed):\r\n\r\n```java\r\ninterface Interface1 {\r\n    default void hello() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hello from Interface1\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface Interface2 {\r\n    default void hello() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hello from Interface2\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Child implements Interface1, Interface2 {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void hello() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hello from Child (resolving ambiguity)\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHello from Child (resolving ambiguity)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Key Point for Interviews:\r\n\r\n- Java avoids **multiple class inheritance** to prevent ambiguity.  \r\n- Instead, Java uses **interfaces** to achieve similar flexibility, with explicit rules to resolve conflicts.  \r\n- This keeps the language **simple, safe, and predictable**.\r\n",

    "content": "\r\nThis is a commonly asked interview question in Java and Spring-related interviews. The answer is:\r\n\r\n> ✅ **Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where an object’s dependencies are supplied by an external entity rather than the object creating them itself.**\r\n\r\n## Why is Dependency Injection Needed?\r\n\r\n- In traditional object-oriented programming, classes create and manage their own dependencies using `new`.  \r\n- This leads to **tight coupling** between classes, making code:  \r\n  - Harder to test (difficult to replace real dependencies with mocks).  \r\n  - Less flexible (changing a dependency impacts multiple classes).  \r\n  - More difficult to maintain.  \r\n\r\nDI solves this by **injecting dependencies from outside** (via constructors, setters, or interfaces).  \r\n\r\n## Types of Dependency Injection\r\n\r\n1. **Constructor Injection**  \r\n   - Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.  \r\n   - Promotes immutability (dependencies cannot be changed after construction).  \r\n\r\n2. **Setter Injection**  \r\n   - Dependencies are assigned through public setters.  \r\n   - Provides flexibility but allows modification after object creation.  \r\n\r\n3. **Interface Injection** (less common in Java)  \r\n   - Dependency is passed via an interface method.  \r\n\r\n## Example Without DI (Tightly Coupled)\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass ServiceA {\r\n    void doSomething() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Service A logic\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass ServiceB {\r\n    private ServiceA serviceA = new ServiceA(); // ❌ Tightly coupled\r\n\r\n    public void execute() {\r\n        serviceA.doSomething();\r\n        System.out.println(\"Service B logic\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Here, `ServiceB` is responsible for **creating** `ServiceA`.  \r\n- If `ServiceA` changes, `ServiceB` must also change.  \r\n\r\n## Example With DI (Loosely Coupled)\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass ServiceA {\r\n    void doSomething() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Service A logic\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass ServiceB {\r\n    private final ServiceA serviceA;\r\n\r\n    // ✅ Dependency is injected via constructor\r\n    public ServiceB(ServiceA serviceA) {\r\n        this.serviceA = serviceA;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void execute() {\r\n        serviceA.doSomething();\r\n        System.out.println(\"Service B logic\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Now `ServiceB` does not create `ServiceA` itself.  \r\n- The dependency is passed externally, making `ServiceB` **testable** and **loosely coupled**.  \r\n\r\n## In Spring Framework\r\n\r\nSpring provides a **Dependency Injection container**:  \r\n- Objects (beans) are defined and managed in the container.  \r\n- Dependencies are automatically **wired** at runtime using annotations like `@Autowired`, `@Inject`, or explicit configuration.  \r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Component\r\nclass ServiceA {\r\n    void doSomething() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Service A logic\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component\r\nclass ServiceB {\r\n    private final ServiceA serviceA;\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    public ServiceB(ServiceA serviceA) {\r\n        this.serviceA = serviceA;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void execute() {\r\n        serviceA.doSomething();\r\n        System.out.println(\"Service B logic\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Key Point for Interviews\r\n\r\n- Dependency Injection = **“Don’t call me, I’ll call you”** (Hollywood Principle).  \r\n- It helps achieve **loose coupling**, **testability**, and **flexibility**.  \r\n- Widely used in frameworks like **Spring**, **Guice**, and **Jakarta EE**.  \r\n",

The answer is:\r\n\r\n> ✅ **Spring is a powerful, lightweight framework that simplifies Java application development by providing infrastructure support such as Dependency Injection, Inversion of Control (IoC), and a modular architecture.**\r\n\r\n## What is the Spring Framework?\r\n\r\n- Spring is an **open-source framework** primarily for building enterprise-level Java applications.  \r\n- It provides a **comprehensive programming and configuration model**.  \r\n- Core features:\r\n  - **Dependency Injection (DI)** and **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: removes tight coupling between components.\r\n  - **Spring MVC**: supports web applications using a Model-View-Controller architecture.\r\n  - **Integration**: works seamlessly with other Java EE technologies (JPA, JMS, JDBC, etc.).\r\n  - **AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)**: helps with cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transactions.\r\n\r\n## Why Should Java Programmers Use Spring?\r\n\r\n- **Most popular Java framework**: Widely adopted across the industry; knowledge of Spring is expected in most Java developer roles.  \r\n- **Reduces boilerplate code**: Handles repetitive infrastructure concerns, so developers can focus on business logic.  \r\n- **Modular**: You can use only what you need (e.g., Spring Core, Spring MVC, Spring Data).  \r\n- **Integration with Spring Boot**: Provides production-ready defaults, embedded servers, and simplifies microservices development.  \r\n- **Community & Ecosystem**: Strong documentation, active community, and a huge ecosystem of projects (Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Cloud, etc.).  \r\n\r\n## Example: Dependency Injection in Spring\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Component\r\nclass ServiceA {\r\n    void doSomething() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Service A logic\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component\r\nclass ServiceB {\r\n    private final ServiceA serviceA;\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    public ServiceB(ServiceA serviceA) {\r\n        this.serviceA = serviceA;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void execute() {\r\n        serviceA.doSomething();\r\n        System.out.println(\"Service B logic\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Spring automatically **injects ServiceA into ServiceB** via the `@Autowired` constructor.  \r\n- This eliminates the need to manually instantiate objects, reducing coupling.  \r\n\r\n## Key Point for Interviews\r\n\r\n- Spring provides the **plumbing** (IoC, DI, AOP, MVC) so that developers can focus on **business logic**.  \r\n- It has become the **standard framework** for modern Java server-side development.  \r\n- With **Spring Boot**, it accelerates microservices and cloud-native applications.  \r\n",
