What I liked about this achievement was not just the technical solution, but the direct business impact.\r\n\r\nAnother highlight was when I designed and implemented a custom load testing service using Helidon, AWS ECS, Lambda, and SQS in a serverless, event-driven architecture. This gave the team an automated way to stress-test our applications, improving reliability and scalability before releases. It was a chance to think end-to-end and architect a system, not just code it.\r\n\r\nI’m also particularly proud of a cost optimization initiative where I identified redundant AWS KMS keys and consolidated them, which cut cloud costs by around 60%. I didn’t just execute the fix — I presented my analysis to stakeholders and got buy-in, which built my confidence in driving technical decisions at a larger scale.\r\n\r\nEarlier in my career at TCS, working with ICICI Prudential as a client, I delivered over 140 requirements including several microservices, and even helped migrate legacy systems to AWS.

The constructor helps to **initialize data members** defined in the abstract class.\r\n\r\n### Important Concepts:\r\n\r\n- Constructors are used to initialize instance variables.\r\n- An abstract class **can have instance variables** (just like any class).\r\n- When a subclass extends an abstract class and is instantiated, the **abstract class constructor is executed first** via an implicit or explicit `super()` call.\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nabstract class Vehicle {\r\n    String type;\r\n\r\n    Vehicle(String type) {\r\n        this.type = type;\r\n        System.out.println(\"Vehicle constructor called: \" + type);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Car extends Vehicle {\r\n    Car() {\r\n        super(\"Car\");\r\n        System.out.println(\"Car constructor called\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Car c = new Car();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nVehicle constructor called: Car\r\nCar constructor called\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs shown above:\r\n- The abstract class `Vehicle` has a constructor.\r\n- When `Car` is instantiated, `Vehicle`'s constructor is called first using `super(\"Car\")`.\r\n\r\nThis demonstrates that **abstract class constructors participate in the object initialization chain**, just like constructors in concrete superclasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

That technical detail is abstracted.\r\n\r\n**In Java**, abstraction can be achieved in two ways:\r\n- Using **abstract classes**\r\n- Using **interfaces**\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Abstract class example\r\nabstract class Animal {\r\n    abstract void makeSound();\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Dog extends Animal {\r\n    void makeSound() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Bark\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. Encapsulation\r\n\r\n**Definition**: Encapsulation is the process of binding data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit — typically a class. It is also used to restrict access to internal details using access modifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`).\r\n\r\nEncapsulation supports **data hiding** and helps in achieving **abstraction**.\r\n\r\n**Example**:  \r\nA Java Bean where all data members are private and are accessed via public getters/setters.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Person {\r\n    private String name;\r\n\r\n    public String getName() {\r\n        return name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setName(String name) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3. Inheritance\r\n\r\n**Definition**: Inheritance allows one class (child/subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent/superclass). This promotes **code reusability** and establishes a **parent-child relationship** between classes.\r\n\r\n> Java supports single inheritance through classes and multiple inheritance through interfaces.\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n```java\r\nclass Animal {\r\n    void eat() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"This animal eats food\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Dog extends Animal {\r\n    void bark() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"The dog barks\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 4. Polymorphism\r\n\r\n**Definition**: \"Poly\" means many, and \"morph\" means forms. Polymorphism allows objects or methods to take multiple forms.\r\n\r\nThere are **two types of polymorphism**:\r\n\r\n#### a) Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)\r\nOccurs when multiple methods have the same name but different parameters in the same class. The method to call is decided at **compile-time**.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass MathUtils {\r\n    int add(int a, int b) {\r\n        return a + b;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    double add(double a, double b) {\r\n        return a + b;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### b) Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)\r\nOccurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass. The method to call is determined at **runtime**.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Animal {\r\n    void sound() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Animal makes sound\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Cat extends Animal {\r\n    void sound() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Cat meows\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Summary Table\r\n\r\n| Pillar        | Key Concept                            | Java Support                         |\r\n|---------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\r\n| Abstraction   | Hide internal details, show only needed| Abstract classes, Interfaces         |\r\n| Encapsulation | Bind data & methods, restrict access   | Classes, Access Modifiers            |\r\n| Inheritance   | Reuse code via parent-child classes    | `extends`, Interfaces (`implements`) |\r\n| Polymorphism  | One name, many forms                   | Overloading & Overriding             |\r\n\r\n",

It can contain:\r\n\r\n- **Abstract methods** (methods without a body)\r\n- **Concrete methods** (methods with a body)\r\n\r\n### Key Characteristics:\r\n\r\n- An abstract class **cannot be instantiated** — you cannot create objects of it directly.\r\n- The purpose of an abstract class is to be **extended** by other classes.\r\n- The **first concrete (non-abstract) subclass** that extends an abstract class **must implement** all its abstract methods.\r\n\r\n### Example in Java:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nabstract class Animal {\r\n    abstract void makeSound();  // abstract method\r\n\r\n    void breathe() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Breathing...\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Dog extends Animal {\r\n    void makeSound() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Bark\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example:\r\n- `Animal` is an abstract class with one abstract method (`makeSound`) and one concrete method (`breathe`).\r\n- `Dog` is a concrete class that provides an implementation for `makeSound`.\r\n\r\nYou **must** override all abstract methods in the first non-abstract subclass, or the subclass itself must be declared `abstract`.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "content": "\r\nThis is a very common design-oriented interview question. The answer is:\r\n\r\n✅ Choose an interface when you want to define a contract for unrelated classes, and choose an abstract class when you want to provide shared state or partial implementation.\r\n\r\nWhen to Use an Abstract Class:\r\n\r\nWhen you want to provide default implementations for some methods while keeping others abstract.\r\n\r\nWhen subclasses need to share common state (fields).\r\n\r\nWhen new methods are expected to be added frequently — because you can provide a default implementation in the abstract class without breaking existing subclasses.\r\n\r\nExample: AbstractList in Java Collections Framework provides skeletal implementations that subclasses can reuse.\r\n\r\nWhen to Use an Interface:\r\n\r\nWhen you want to define a contract that multiple, potentially unrelated, classes can implement.\r\n\r\nWhen you need multiple inheritance of type (since a class can implement multiple interfaces but extend only one class).\r\n\r\nWhen you are designing APIs that should be flexible and loosely coupled.\r\n\r\nExample: List, Set, and Queue interfaces define behaviors that can be implemented by many classes.\r\n\r\nJava 8+ Consideration:\r\n\r\nFrom Java 8 onwards, interfaces can have default and static methods, which makes them slightly closer to abstract classes. However:\r\n\r\nInterfaces still cannot have instance fields.\r\n\r\nAbstract classes are better if you need to share stateful logic.\r\n\r\nInterfaces remain the go-to choice when you need polymorphism across unrelated types.\r\n\r\nBest Practice:\r\n\r\nPrefer interfaces when in doubt, especially for API design.\r\n\r\nUse abstract classes only when you need state + partial implementation.\r\n\r\n```\r\nExample:\r\ninterface Drivable {\r\n    void drive();\r\n\r\n    default void service() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Default vehicle service.\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nabstract class Vehicle {\r\n    String name;\r\n\r\n    Vehicle(String name) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void fuelUp() {\r\n        System.out.println(name + \" is refueling...\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    abstract void honk();\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Car extends Vehicle implements Drivable {\r\n    Car(String name) {\r\n        super(name);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    void honk() {\r\n        System.out.println(name + \" says: Beep beep!\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void drive() {\r\n        System.out.println(name + \" is driving...\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Car car = new Car(\"Tesla\");\r\n        car.drive();\r\n        car.service();\r\n        car.fuelUp();\r\n        car.honk();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\nTesla is driving...\r\nDefault vehicle service.\r\nTesla is refueling...\r\nTesla says: Beep beep!\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterview Tip:\r\n\r\nUse abstract class if you need to share state or provide default implementation for evolving behavior.\r\n\r\nUse interface when you need a clean contract and multiple inheritance.\r\n\r\nEven after Java 8’s default methods, the main distinction remains:\r\n\r\nInterfaces define contracts.\r\n\r\nAbstract classes provide base implementations and state.\r\n",
