    "content": "\r\nLink: https://blog.algomaster.io/p/rest-vs-graphql\r\n\r\n## REST API vs GraphQL\r\n\r\nBoth **REST** and **GraphQL** are popular approaches for designing APIs, but they differ significantly in **data fetching, flexibility, and efficiency**. Understanding these differences is crucial for choosing the right approach in modern web and mobile applications.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## ✅ REST API\r\n\r\nREST (**Representational State Transfer**) is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) for resource manipulation.\r\n\r\n### Characteristics:\r\n- **Resource-based** → Each endpoint represents a resource (`/users`, `/orders`, etc.).  \r\n- **Fixed endpoints** → You usually design multiple endpoints for different use cases.  \r\n- **Over-fetching/Under-fetching** → Clients may get more data than needed or not enough, requiring multiple requests.  \r\n- Uses JSON (commonly) but can return XML, HTML, etc.  \r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n```http\r\nGET /users/123\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": 123,\r\n  \"name\": \"Alice\",\r\n  \"email\": \"alice@example.com\",\r\n  \"phone\": \"123-456-7890\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- Even if the client only needs `name`, the entire payload is returned.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## ✅ GraphQL\r\n\r\nGraphQL is a **query language for APIs** developed by Facebook. Clients can request **exactly the data they need** in a single query.\r\n\r\n### Characteristics:\r\n- **Single endpoint** (`/graphql`) → all requests are sent as queries.  \r\n- **Client-driven data fetching** → Clients specify what fields they need.  \r\n- Avoids over-fetching and under-fetching.  \r\n- Strongly typed schema → Provides introspection and validation.  \r\n- Can aggregate data from multiple sources in one request.  \r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n```graphql\r\nquery {\r\n  user(id: 123) {\r\n    name\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Response:**\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"user\": {\r\n      \"name\": \"Alice\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- Only `name` is returned.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🔑 Key Differences\r\n\r\n| Aspect                | REST API                                  | GraphQL                                |\r\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\r\n| **Data Fetching**      | Fixed responses, may over/under-fetch     | Client chooses exact fields             |\r\n| **Endpoints**          | Multiple endpoints for resources          | Single endpoint with flexible queries   |\r\n| **Performance**        | May require multiple requests             | Often one request is enough             |\r\n| **Schema**             | No strict schema enforced                 | Strongly typed schema                   |\r\n| **Versioning**         | Common (e.g., `/v1/`, `/v2/`)             | Usually avoided, schema evolves         |\r\n| **Learning Curve**     | Easier, widely adopted                    | Steeper (needs schema, resolvers)       |\r\n| **Caching**            | Easy with HTTP caching                    | More complex, requires custom solutions |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📌 When to Use What?\r\n\r\n- **REST API** is a good choice if:\r\n  - Your API is simple, resource-based, and unlikely to change frequently.  \r\n  - You want to leverage HTTP caching and existing tooling.  \r\n  - You need quick development and wide compatibility.  \r\n\r\n- **GraphQL** is a good choice if:\r\n  - Clients (web, mobile) need **different shapes of data**.  \r\n  - Your API aggregates data from **multiple services/sources**.  \r\n  - Reducing network requests is critical (e.g., mobile apps).  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 👉 Interview Tip\r\n\r\nIf asked in interviews:\r\n- Emphasize **GraphQL’s flexibility** vs **REST’s simplicity and maturity**.  \r\n- Mention that **GraphQL can be overkill** for simple APIs.  \r\n- Also note that REST still dominates in many real-world systems, but GraphQL is popular in startups and front-end heavy apps.\r\n\r\n",

I built a custom Spring Boot application that could dynamically read and update lists, which significantly reduced manual effort and improved efficiency for the operations team. What I liked about this achievement was not just the technical solution, but the direct business impact.\r\n\r\nAnother highlight was when I designed and implemented a custom load testing service using Helidon, AWS ECS, Lambda, and SQS in a serverless, event-driven architecture. This gave the team an automated way to stress-test our applications, improving reliability and scalability before releases. It was a chance to think end-to-end and architect a system, not just code it.\r\n\r\nI’m also particularly proud of a cost optimization initiative where I identified redundant AWS KMS keys and consolidated them, which cut cloud costs by around 60%. I didn’t just execute the fix — I presented my analysis to stakeholders and got buy-in, which built my confidence in driving technical decisions at a larger scale.\r\n\r\nEarlier in my career at TCS, working with ICICI Prudential as a client, I delivered over 140 requirements including several microservices, and even helped migrate legacy systems to AWS. That experience gave me both technical grounding and exposure to how large-scale financial systems operate.\r\n\r\nAcross both roles, what I’m proud of is not just delivering code, but finding ways to make systems faster, cheaper, and more reliable, while also contributing to team knowledge-sharing.\r\n\r\n",

The answer is:\r\n\r\n✅ Abstract classes and interfaces both provide abstraction, but they differ in purpose, usage, and capabilities.\r\n\r\n# Key Differences:\r\n\r\n## Methods:\r\n\r\nAbstract class → Can have both abstract and concrete methods.\r\n\r\nInterface → Before Java 8, only abstract methods; from Java 8 onwards, can have default and static methods; from Java 9, private methods too.\r\n\r\n## Access Modifiers:\r\n\r\nAbstract class → Methods can have any access modifier (public, protected, private).\r\n\r\nInterface → All methods are implicitly public and abstract (except default, static, and private methods which have fixed modifiers).\r\n\r\n## Variables:\r\n\r\nAbstract class → Can have final, non-final, static, and non-static variables.\r\n\r\nInterface → Variables are always public static final (constants).\r\n\r\n## Inheritance:\r\n\r\nAbstract class → A class can extend only one abstract (or concrete) class because Java does not support multiple class inheritance.\r\n\r\nInterface → A class can implement multiple interfaces, achieving multiple inheritance of type.\r\n\r\n## Extensibility:\r\n\r\nAbstract class → Can extend another class (abstract or concrete) and implement multiple interfaces.\r\n\r\nInterface → Can only extend other interfaces, not classes.\r\n\r\n## Use-case:\r\n\r\nAbstract class → Used when classes share a common state or base implementation.\r\n\r\nInterface → Used to define a contract of behavior across unrelated classes.\r\n\r\n```\r\nExample:\r\nabstract class Animal {\r\n    String name;\r\n\r\n    Animal(String name) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    abstract void makeSound();\r\n\r\n    void sleep() {\r\n        System.out.println(name + \" is sleeping...\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface Pet {\r\n    void play();\r\n\r\n    default void feed() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Feeding the pet...\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Dog extends Animal implements Pet {\r\n    Dog(String name) {\r\n        super(name);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    void makeSound() {\r\n        System.out.println(name + \" barks!\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void play() {\r\n        System.out.println(name + \" is playing fetch!\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Dog d = new Dog(\"Buddy\");\r\n        d.makeSound();\r\n        d.sleep();\r\n        d.play();\r\n        d.feed();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\nBuddy barks!\r\nBuddy is sleeping...\r\nBuddy is playing fetch!\r\nFeeding the pet...\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterview Tip:\r\n\r\nEven though Java 8 introduced default and static methods in interfaces, the core difference still remains:\r\n\r\nA class can extend only one abstract class,\r\n\r\nBut it can implement multiple interfaces.\r\n\r\nThat’s why interfaces are preferred when you need multiple inheritance of behavior, while abstract classes are better suited when you need a shared base state and implementation.\r\n\r\nVersion-specific Notes:\r\n\r\nJava 7 and below → Interfaces could only have abstract methods and constants.\r\n\r\nJava 8 → Introduced default and static methods in interfaces.\r\n\r\nJava 9 → Added private methods in interfaces.\r\n\r\nThus, abstract classes and interfaces complement each other but serve different design purposes in Java.",

If an exception occurs in a method and is not handled there, the method **exits immediately** and passes the exception to its **caller**.\r\n2. This continues up the stack until:\r\n   - The exception is caught by a `catch` block, or  \r\n   - It reaches the JVM (which will terminate the program).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Example of Exception Propagation\r\n```java\r\npublic class PropagationExample {\r\n\r\n    void method1() {\r\n        int result = 10 / 0; // ArithmeticException\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void method2() {\r\n        method1(); // Exception propagates here\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void method3() {\r\n        try {\r\n            method2();\r\n        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {\r\n            System.out.println(\"Exception handled in method3\");\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        PropagationExample obj = new PropagationExample();\r\n        obj.method3();\r\n        System.out.println(\"Program continues...\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output:**\r\n```\r\nException handled in method3\r\nProgram continues...\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n- **`throw`** → Used to throw an exception object.  \r\n- **`throws`** → Used to declare exceptions a method might throw.  \r\n- **Exception Propagation** → If an exception is not handled in a method, it propagates to the caller until it’s caught or the program terminates.\r\n\r\n✅ Interview Tip: Always highlight that **checked exceptions must be declared with `throws`** if not handled, while unchecked exceptions (like `RuntimeException`) are propagated automatically.\r\n\r\n",

Sealed Classes**\r\n- **What it is**: A way to restrict which classes can extend or implement a class/interface.\r\n- **Why**: Provides better control of inheritance, useful for domain modeling.\r\n- **Example**:\r\n  ```java\r\n  public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {}\r\n  public final class Circle extends Shape {}\r\n  public final class Rectangle extends Shape {}\r\n  ```\r\n- **Use case**: Helps model closed hierarchies (e.g., a limited set of `Shape` types).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **2. Records**\r\n- **What it is**: A concise way to define immutable data classes.\r\n- **Why**: Reduces boilerplate (`getters`, `equals`, `hashCode`, `toString`).\r\n- **Example**:\r\n  ```java\r\n  public record Point(int x, int y) {}\r\n  ```\r\n- **Use case**: DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), value carriers, entities with no mutable state.\r\n\r\nRecords are implicitly immutable, meaning their state cannot be changed after creation. This simplifies reasoning about data, reduces the potential for bugs, and can improve thread safety in concurrent applications.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **3. Pattern Matching for `instanceof`**\r\n- **What it is**: Simplifies type checking and casting.\r\n- **Why**: Avoids redundant casting code after `instanceof`.\r\n- **Example**:\r\n  ```java\r\n  if (obj instanceof String s) {\r\n      System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n- **Use case**: Cleaner and safer type handling in polymorphic code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **4. Text Blocks**\r\n- **What it is**: Multi-line string literals using `\"\"\"`.\r\n- **Why**: Improves readability of JSON, SQL, HTML, and other multi-line text.\r\n- **Example**:\r\n  ```java\r\n  String json = \"\"\"\r\n      {\r\n        \"id\": 1,\r\n        \"name\": \"Java 17\"\r\n      }\r\n      \"\"\";\r\n  ```\r\n- **Use case**: Embedding JSON/XML/SQL queries directly in Java code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **5. Switch Expressions**\r\n- **What it is**: Enhances `switch` to return values and use lambda-style syntax.\r\n- **Why**: More concise and less error-prone.\r\n- **Example**:\r\n  ```java\r\n  int result = switch (day) {\r\n      case MONDAY, FRIDAY -> 6;\r\n      case TUESDAY -> 7;\r\n      default -> 0;\r\n  };\r\n  ```\r\n- **Use case**: Assigning values directly from a `switch` instead of using long `if-else` chains.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Quick Comparison Table\r\n\r\n| Feature                  | Java 11                              | Java 17                                        |\r\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\r\n| LTS Release Year          | 2018                                  | 2021                                          |\r\n| Language Features         | No major new syntax                   | Sealed classes, Records, Pattern Matching, Text Blocks, Switch Expressions |\r\n| String Enhancements       | `isBlank()`, `lines()`, `repeat()`   | Inherits Java 11 + new Stream/CharSequence APIs |\r\n| Garbage Collectors        | Experimental ZGC                     | Production-ready ZGC & Shenandoah             |\r\n| JDK Cleanup               | Removed Java EE, CORBA               | Deprecated Security Manager, Applets          |\r\n| Licensing                 | Oracle commercial license             | Free under Oracle No-Fee Terms until 2029     |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 👉 Interview Tip\r\n- **Java 11** = cleanup + API improvements.  \r\n- **Java 17** = modern Java (records, sealed classes, text blocks, switch expressions, pattern matching).  \r\n- Always emphasize that **Java 17 is the recommended LTS for new projects** due to richer language features and extended support.\r\n\r\n",

    "content": "\r\nYes — this is a common interview question, and the answer is:\r\n\r\n> ✅ **Yes, abstract classes in Java do have constructors.**  \r\nYou can define one explicitly, or Java will provide a default constructor if you don't.\r\n\r\n### Why does an abstract class need a constructor?\r\n\r\nEven though you **cannot instantiate** an abstract class directly, its constructor is still called **when a subclass is instantiated**. The constructor helps to **initialize data members** defined in the abstract class.\r\n\r\n### Important Concepts:\r\n\r\n- Constructors are used to initialize instance variables.\r\n- An abstract class **can have instance variables** (just like any class).\r\n- When a subclass extends an abstract class and is instantiated, the **abstract class constructor is executed first** via an implicit or explicit `super()` call.\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nabstract class Vehicle {\r\n    String type;\r\n\r\n    Vehicle(String type) {\r\n        this.type = type;\r\n        System.out.println(\"Vehicle constructor called: \" + type);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Car extends Vehicle {\r\n    Car() {\r\n        super(\"Car\");\r\n        System.out.println(\"Car constructor called\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Car c = new Car();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nVehicle constructor called: Car\r\nCar constructor called\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs shown above:\r\n- The abstract class `Vehicle` has a constructor.\r\n- When `Car` is instantiated, `Vehicle`'s constructor is called first using `super(\"Car\")`.\r\n\r\nThis demonstrates that **abstract class constructors participate in the object initialization chain**, just like constructors in concrete superclasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "content": "\r\n## Overview\r\nIn Java, threads are used to execute tasks **concurrently**.  \r\nThere are **two primary ways** to create a thread:\r\n\r\n1. By **extending the `Thread` class**.  \r\n2. By **implementing the `Runnable` interface**.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Java 5 introduced the **`Executor` framework**, which is the recommended way in modern applications.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1. Creating a Thread by Extending `Thread`\r\n- **How:** Subclass `Thread` and override its `run()` method.\r\n- **When to use:** If you don’t need to extend any other class.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass MyThread extends Thread {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void run() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Thread running: \" + Thread.currentThread().getName());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class ThreadExample {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();\r\n        t1.start();  // start() internally calls run()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. Creating a Thread by Implementing `Runnable`\r\n- **How:** Implement `Runnable` and pass it to a `Thread` object.\r\n- **When to use:** Preferred when you want to extend another class (since Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance).\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass MyRunnable implements Runnable {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void run() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Runnable thread running: \" + Thread.currentThread().getName());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class RunnableExample {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());\r\n        t1.start();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3. Using Lambda with `Runnable` (Java 8+)\r\n- **Why:** Cleaner, concise code.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class LambdaThreadExample {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> \r\n            System.out.println(\"Lambda thread running: \" + Thread.currentThread().getName())\r\n        );\r\n        t1.start();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4. Using Executor Framework (Recommended)\r\n- **Why:** Provides thread pooling, better resource management, and avoids manually handling threads.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;\r\nimport java.util.concurrent.Executors;\r\n\r\npublic class ExecutorExample {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);\r\n\r\n        executor.submit(() -> System.out.println(\"Task 1 executed by: \" + Thread.currentThread().getName()));\r\n        executor.submit(() -> System.out.println(\"Task 2 executed by: \" + Thread.currentThread().getName()));\r\n\r\n        executor.shutdown();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n| Approach               | Pros | Cons |\r\n|------------------------|------|------|\r\n| Extending `Thread`     | Simple, direct | No multiple inheritance |\r\n| Implementing `Runnable`| Flexible, decouples task from thread | Slightly more verbose |\r\n| Lambda Runnable        | Concise, modern | Same as `Runnable` underneath |\r\n| Executor Framework     | Scalable, efficient, production-ready | Slightly more complex API |\r\n\r\n✅ **Best practice:** Use the **Executor framework** for real-world applications, as it is scalable and avoids creating too many raw threads.\r\n\r\n",

    "content": "\r\n## What’s New in Java 21 — In Depth\r\n\r\nJava 21 is an LTS release that delivers several finalized features, previews, and incubating APIs. Many of these features address pain points in concurrency, expressiveness of the language, and interactions outside the JVM (native code). Below are some of the major new concepts, what they are, and why they were needed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1. Virtual Threads (JEP 444) — Finalized in Java 21  \r\n**What it is:**  \r\n- Virtual threads are lightweight threads managed by the JVM rather than by the OS. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  \r\n- They behave almost like regular (platform) threads from the API point of view — you can use `Thread`, `ExecutorService`, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  \r\n- They support thread-local variables, and have better diagnostics, monitoring, and visibility in thread dumps. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  \r\n\r\n**Why introduced:**  \r\n- To simplify high-concurrency applications by reducing the overhead of OS threads. Before, writing scalable servers required complex non-blocking or reactive code to avoid blocking OS threads. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  \r\n- Improve efficiency for I/O-bound workloads (which spend a lot of time waiting). Because virtual threads yield the underlying carrier thread during waiting/blocking, more work can be done with fewer system threads. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  \r\n\r\n**Use cases / implications:**  \r\n- Web servers handling many connections.  \r\n- Environments where many tasks wait on I/O (database, file, network).  \r\n- Simplifies migration from blocking code to more scalable concurrency without rewriting everything in reactive style.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. Sequenced Collections (JEP 431)  \r\n**What it is:**  \r\n- New collection interfaces to represent data structures where elements have a defined encounter order, including clear first and last elements. These include `SequencedCollection`, `SequencedSet`, `SequencedMap`. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  \r\n- The existing `List`, `Deque`, etc., already had orders, but there was no top-level type to abstract over “something that has order, first, last, predecessor/successor” across different collection types. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  \r\n\r\n**Why introduced:**  \r\n- To reduce boilerplate and improve API uniformity when you need ordered collections (e.g. operations that need first/last, reverse iteration).  \r\n- Makes client code easier to write and reason about when dealing with ordered data, without knowing exact concrete implementation (List, Deque, etc.).  \r\n\r\n**Use cases:**  \r\n- When working with chronological data (logs, event streams).  \r\n- Queues/deques where you need first or last frequently.  \r\n- APIs that need to accept ordered maps/sets generically.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3. String Templates (Preview, JEP 430)  (Currently removed in Java 23 for redesign)\r\n**What it is:**  \r\n- A new syntax to embed expressions into string literals/text blocks with processors. These templates allow combining literal text and embedded expressions, somewhat like interpolation, but with more safety and flexibility. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  \r\n\r\n**Why introduced:**  \r\n- Current ways to build strings (concatenation, `StringBuilder`, `format`) are:\r\n  - Verbose or error-prone.  \r\n  - Hard to read when mixing literal text with expressions.  \r\n  - Localization and escaping become tricky. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  \r\n\r\n- String templates help readability, maintainability, and reduce errors in string composition.  \r\n\r\n**Use cases:**  \r\n- Generating messages, SQL, JSON, or any templated text where you mix variable content.  \r\n- Code that deals with localization.  \r\n- Avoiding manual escaping and concatenation errors.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4. Record Patterns (Standard in Java 21)  \r\n**What it is:**  \r\n- Allows “destructuring” record types directly in patterns — for example, matching if an object is a record and binding its components in one pattern. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  \r\n\r\n**Why introduced:**  \r\n- To make working with immutable data types (records) more ergonomic. Instead of writing boilerplate `instanceof` + casting + getters, the patterns let you extract record components in a readable concise way.  \r\n- Enhances safety and clarity in code that deconstructs many record types.  \r\n\r\n**Use cases:**  \r\n- Pattern matching in `switch` statements or `if` statements when your objects are records.  \r\n- Simplifying visitor-like code.  \r\n- Cleaner data processing pipelines.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5. Foreign Function & Memory API (Third Preview)  \r\n**What it is:**  \r\n- Also called the “Panama” APIs: they allow Java programs to interoperate with native code safely and more efficiently than JNI.  \r\n- Also improvements in memory layout, management of off-heap memory (native memory) safely. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  \r\n\r\n**Why introduced:**  \r\n- JNI has been historically complex, unsafe, verbose, and error prone.  \r\n- Many applications need efficient access to native libraries (e.g., for performance, hardware access, or specialized libraries).  \r\n- Better safety guarantees, performance, and developer ergonomics.  \r\n\r\n**Use cases:**  \r\n- Interacting with native code (e.g., system libraries, graphics, specialized hardware).  \r\n- Performance-sensitive tasks where off-heap memory matters.  \r\n- Where JNI is too heavy-weight or unsafe.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 6. Structured Concurrency (Preview)  \r\n**What it is:**  \r\n- A new API to handle groups of related tasks (threads) as a *single unit of work*. It ensures error propagation, clean cancellation, and more predictable lifecycles. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  \r\n\r\n**Why introduced:**  \r\n- Traditional concurrency with futures, threads, executors, etc., can lead to thread leaks, poorly managed cancellation, complicated error handling, and difficulty tracking tasks.  \r\n- Structured concurrency builds discipline into how concurrent code is written.  \r\n\r\n**Use cases:**  \r\n- Complex concurrent workflows: e.g., where multiple sub-tasks are launched and you need to wait for all or cancel all if one fails.  \r\n- Server code handling multiple subtasks per request.  \r\n- Cleaner and safer composition of asynchronous operations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 7. Generational ZGC (Z Garbage Collector)  \r\n**What it is:**  \r\n- ZGC is a low-latency garbage collector. In Java 21, it adds **generational** behavior: separating young and old objects, collecting young objects more frequently. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  \r\n\r\n**Why introduced:**  \r\n- Many objects in Java die young, so focusing GC work on young generation often reduces work and pauses.  \r\n- Previous ZGC was more uniform; generational ZGC allows more efficient memory use and better performance in many common workload patterns.\r\n\r\n**Use cases:**  \r\n- Applications with large heaps with many short-lived objects.  \r\n- Performance-critical services where GC pause time and throughput matter.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 8. Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) API (JEP 452)  \r\n**What it is:**  \r\n- An API for modern cryptographic schemes to encapsulate symmetric keys using asymmetric or public key cryptography. Includes support for algorithms like RSA-KEM, ECIES, and prospective post-quantum ones. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  \r\n\r\n**Why introduced:**  \r\n- Security is always evolving. Key encapsulation is useful in secure protocols (TLS, HPKE etc.).  \r\n- Need for standardized, safe, well tested APIs for cryptography.  \r\n\r\n**Use cases:**  \r\n- Secure communications protocols.  \r\n- Applications implementing their own encryption schemes, hybrid encryption.  \r\n- Systems preparing for post-quantum security.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Key Trade-offs & Challenges\r\n\r\nWhile Java 21 introduces these powerful features, there are also some aspects developers need to be aware of:\r\n\r\n- Virtual Threads are not a silver bullet: blocking in native code / synchronized blocks can “pin” threads, hurting scalability. Libraries/frameworks must be aware. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  \r\n- Preview and incubator features (String Templates, Foreign Memory API, Structured Concurrency) are not yet final — behavior/APIs may change.  \r\n- Adoption requires updated ecosystem (frameworks, libraries) to support new concurrency models, etc.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Why These Features Matter Together\r\n\r\n- Many of the new features are about **improving developer productivity** (e.g. record patterns, string templates).  \r\n- Others address long-standing performance bottlenecks, especially in concurrency (virtual threads, structured concurrency, generational GC).  \r\n- There is a focus on **safety and expressiveness** (sealed types, record patterns, Foreign Function & Memory API).  \r\n- Also, improving the platform’s readiness for security evolution (KEM) and better interaction with native code.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Interview Tips\r\n\r\nIf asked about Java 21 in interviews:\r\n\r\n- Mention it is an **LTS release**, which means long support.  \r\n- Focus on **virtual threads** — this is often the standout item. Be ready to explain both what they are and what their limitations are (e.g. thread-pinning etc.).  \r\n- Talk about the language enhancements (record patterns, pattern matching, string templates) as ways to reduce boilerplate and make code more readable.  \r\n- Also emphasize the incubator/preview features (Structured Concurrency, Foreign Memory API), and precaution about using preview features in production.  \r\n\r\n",

Single Abstract Method).  \r\n- **Why:** Allow Lambda expressions to be used as implementations.  \r\n- **Examples:** `Runnable`, `Callable`, `Comparator`, or custom ones annotated with `@FunctionalInterface`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3. **Streams API**\r\n- **What:** A new abstraction for processing collections in a **declarative, pipeline style**.  \r\n- **Why:** To simplify bulk operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing, without writing loops.  \r\n- **Example:**\r\n  ```java\r\n  List<String> names = Arrays.asList(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\");\r\n  List<String> filtered = names.stream()\r\n                               .filter(n -> n.startsWith(\"A\"))\r\n                               .toList();\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 4. **Default and Static Methods in Interfaces**\r\n- **What:** Interfaces can now contain `default` and `static` methods with implementations.  \r\n- **Why:** To evolve interfaces without breaking existing implementations.  \r\n- **Example:**\r\n  ```java\r\n  interface Vehicle {\r\n      default void start() {\r\n          System.out.println(\"Starting vehicle...\");\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 5. **Method References**\r\n- **What:** Shorthand for calling methods via `::`.  \r\n- **Why:** To make code more concise and readable.  \r\n- **Example:**\r\n  ```java\r\n  names.forEach(System.out::println);\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 6. **Optional Class**\r\n- **What:** A container object that may or may not contain a value.  \r\n- **Why:** To reduce `NullPointerException` issues and encourage safer handling of missing values.  \r\n- **Example:**\r\n  ```java\r\n  Optional<String> value = Optional.ofNullable(null);\r\n  System.out.println(value.orElse(\"Default\"));\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 7. **New Date and Time API (java.time)**\r\n- **What:** New immutable classes like `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, and `ZonedDateTime`.  \r\n- **Why:** Old `Date` and `Calendar` APIs were mutable and poorly designed.  \r\n- **Example:**\r\n  ```java\r\n  LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();\r\n  LocalDate future = today.plusDays(10);\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 8. **Nashorn JavaScript Engine**\r\n- **What:** A JavaScript runtime for running JS code inside Java applications.  \r\n- **Why:** To provide better performance and replace the old Rhino engine.  \r\n- **Example:**\r\n  ```java\r\n  ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName(\"nashorn\");\r\n  engine.eval(\"print('Hello from JavaScript!')\");\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 9. **CompletableFuture and Enhanced Concurrency APIs**\r\n- **What:** A more powerful Future with async callbacks (`thenApply`, `thenAccept`).  \r\n- **Why:** To make asynchronous programming easier and more expressive.  \r\n- **Example:**\r\n  ```java\r\n  CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> \"Hello\")\r\n                   .thenApply(str -> str + \" World\")\r\n                   .thenAccept(System.out::println);\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n| Feature                       | Why Introduced                                   |\r\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Lambda Expressions            | Enable functional programming & concise syntax   |\r\n| Functional Interfaces          | Support Lambdas (SAM interfaces)                |\r\n| Streams API                   | Declarative collection processing                |\r\n| Default & Static Methods       | Evolve interfaces without breaking compatibility|\r\n| Method References             | Cleaner syntax for method calls                  |\r\n| Optional Class                 | Reduce `NullPointerException`                   |\r\n| New Date/Time API              | Replace old, buggy `Date` & `Calendar`          |\r\n| Nashorn JS Engine              | Better JavaScript integration                   |\r\n| CompletableFuture              | Simplify async programming                      |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n✅ **In short:** Java 8 made Java **more modern, functional, and safer** by addressing long-standing pain points while keeping backward compatibility.\r\n",

    "content": "\r\n## Core Rule\r\nWhen overriding a method in Java:\r\n- The **exception contract** between parent and child methods must be respected.\r\n- Checked exceptions (those that extend `Exception`, excluding `RuntimeException`) have **stricter rules** than unchecked exceptions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Rules for **Checked Exceptions**\r\n\r\n### 1. If the parent method **does not declare** any checked exceptions\r\n- **Child cannot declare new checked exceptions.**\r\n- Reason: This would break polymorphism since callers of the parent class method are not prepared to handle new checked exceptions.\r\n\r\n✅ Allowed:\r\n```java\r\nclass Parent {\r\n    void show() {}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Child extends Parent {\r\n    @Override\r\n    void show() {  // no checked exceptions\r\n        System.out.println(\"Child implementation\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n❌ Not Allowed:\r\n```java\r\nclass Child extends Parent {\r\n    @Override\r\n    void show() throws IOException {  // Compilation error\r\n        System.out.println(\"Child implementation\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. If the parent method **declares a checked exception**\r\n- Child can declare:\r\n  - The **same exception**  \r\n  - A **subclass** of the exception  \r\n- Child **cannot declare a broader or new checked exception**.\r\n\r\n✅ Allowed:\r\n```java\r\nclass Parent {\r\n    void show() throws IOException {}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Child extends Parent {\r\n    @Override\r\n    void show() throws FileNotFoundException {  // subclass of IOException\r\n        System.out.println(\"Child implementation\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n❌ Not Allowed:\r\n```java\r\nclass Child extends Parent {\r\n    @Override\r\n    void show() throws Exception {  // broader than IOException\r\n        System.out.println(\"Child implementation\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Rules for **Unchecked Exceptions**\r\n\r\nUnchecked exceptions (subclasses of `RuntimeException`) are **not enforced by the compiler**.  \r\n\r\n- A child class can declare **new unchecked exceptions** even if the parent does not.  \r\n- A child can declare **broader unchecked exceptions** as well.  \r\n\r\n✅ Allowed:\r\n```java\r\nclass Parent {\r\n    void show() {}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Child extends Parent {\r\n    @Override\r\n    void show() throws ArithmeticException {  // unchecked exception\r\n        int x = 1 / 0;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Rules for `Error` (like `OutOfMemoryError`)\r\n- Similar to unchecked exceptions → child can freely declare them.\r\n- Not recommended in real-world practice because `Error` represents serious system failures.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary Table\r\n\r\n| Parent Declaration | Child Declaration | Allowed? | Reason |\r\n|---------------------|-------------------|----------|--------|\r\n| No checked exception | Declares new checked exception | ❌ | Breaks contract |\r\n| Declares checked exception (e.g., `IOException`) | Declares same or subclass | ✅ | Narrower is okay |\r\n| Declares checked exception (e.g., `IOException`) | Declares broader (e.g., `Exception`) | ❌ | Breaks contract |\r\n| Declares checked exception | Declares none | ✅ | Narrowing is allowed |\r\n| Any | Declares unchecked (`RuntimeException`) | ✅ | Compiler doesn’t enforce |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Interview Tip\r\nIf asked:  \r\n👉 *“Why can a child not declare broader checked exceptions?”*  \r\nAnswer: Because overriding must adhere to the **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** — anywhere a parent class is used, the child class must be substitutable without forcing the caller to handle unexpected checked exceptions.\r\n\r\n",

    "content": "\r\nThe four fundamental pillars of OOP are:\r\n\r\n1. **Abstraction**  \r\n2. **Encapsulation**  \r\n3. **Inheritance**  \r\n4. **Polymorphism**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 1. Abstraction\r\n\r\n**Definition**: Abstraction is the process of hiding internal implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user.\r\n\r\n**Real-world examples**:\r\n- **TV Remote**: To turn on the TV, you press the power button — you don’t need to know how the internal circuits work or how infrared signals are transmitted.\r\n- **Car Gear**: You know what happens when you change gears, but the underlying mechanism is hidden from you. That technical detail is abstracted.\r\n\r\n**In Java**, abstraction can be achieved in two ways:\r\n- Using **abstract classes**\r\n- Using **interfaces**\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Abstract class example\r\nabstract class Animal {\r\n    abstract void makeSound();\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Dog extends Animal {\r\n    void makeSound() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Bark\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. Encapsulation\r\n\r\n**Definition**: Encapsulation is the process of binding data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit — typically a class. It is also used to restrict access to internal details using access modifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`).\r\n\r\nEncapsulation supports **data hiding** and helps in achieving **abstraction**.\r\n\r\n**Example**:  \r\nA Java Bean where all data members are private and are accessed via public getters/setters.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Person {\r\n    private String name;\r\n\r\n    public String getName() {\r\n        return name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setName(String name) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3. Inheritance\r\n\r\n**Definition**: Inheritance allows one class (child/subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent/superclass). This promotes **code reusability** and establishes a **parent-child relationship** between classes.\r\n\r\n> Java supports single inheritance through classes and multiple inheritance through interfaces.\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n```java\r\nclass Animal {\r\n    void eat() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"This animal eats food\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Dog extends Animal {\r\n    void bark() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"The dog barks\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 4. Polymorphism\r\n\r\n**Definition**: \"Poly\" means many, and \"morph\" means forms. Polymorphism allows objects or methods to take multiple forms.\r\n\r\nThere are **two types of polymorphism**:\r\n\r\n#### a) Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)\r\nOccurs when multiple methods have the same name but different parameters in the same class. The method to call is decided at **compile-time**.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass MathUtils {\r\n    int add(int a, int b) {\r\n        return a + b;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    double add(double a, double b) {\r\n        return a + b;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### b) Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)\r\nOccurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass. The method to call is determined at **runtime**.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Animal {\r\n    void sound() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Animal makes sound\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Cat extends Animal {\r\n    void sound() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Cat meows\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Summary Table\r\n\r\n| Pillar        | Key Concept                            | Java Support                         |\r\n|---------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\r\n| Abstraction   | Hide internal details, show only needed| Abstract classes, Interfaces         |\r\n| Encapsulation | Bind data & methods, restrict access   | Classes, Access Modifiers            |\r\n| Inheritance   | Reuse code via parent-child classes    | `extends`, Interfaces (`implements`) |\r\n| Polymorphism  | One name, many forms                   | Overloading & Overriding             |\r\n\r\n",

    "content": "\r\nThis is a classic core Java interview question. The answer is:\r\n\r\n> ✅ **Method Overloading and Method Overriding both allow polymorphism in Java, but they follow different rules.**\r\n\r\n## Method Overloading Rules\r\n\r\nTwo methods are considered **overloaded** if they meet the following criteria:\r\n\r\n1. **Same method name**.  \r\n2. **Different parameter list** (number or type of arguments must differ).  \r\n\r\nAdditional notes:  \r\n- They **may or may not** have different access modifiers.  \r\n- They **may or may not** have different return types.  \r\n- They **may or may not** throw different checked or unchecked exceptions.  \r\n- Resolution of overloaded methods happens at **compile time** (compile-time polymorphism).\r\n\r\n### Example of Overloading\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass MathUtils {\r\n    int add(int a, int b) {\r\n        return a + b;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    double add(double a, double b) {\r\n        return a + b;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Method Overriding Rules\r\n\r\nThe overriding method in a child class must follow these rules:\r\n\r\n1. **Same method name** as the parent method.  \r\n2. **Same parameter list** as the parent method.  \r\n3. Return type must be **same** or **covariant** (subclass of the parent’s return type).  \r\n4. Must not throw **broader checked exceptions** than the parent method.  \r\n5. Must not have a **more restrictive access modifier**.  \r\n   - Example: If the parent method is `public`, the child method **cannot** be `protected` or `private`.  \r\n\r\nAdditional notes:  \r\n- Resolution of overridden methods happens at **runtime** (runtime polymorphism).  \r\n- Only **instance methods** can be overridden. `static`, `final`, and `private` methods cannot be overridden.  \r\n\r\n### Example of Overriding\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Parent {\r\n    public Number getValue() throws IOException {\r\n        return 42;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Child extends Parent {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public Integer getValue() throws IOException {  // Covariant return type\r\n        return 99;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Key Point for Interviews\r\n\r\n- **Overloading** = same method name, different parameter list → **compile-time polymorphism**.  \r\n- **Overriding** = same method signature in parent and child → **runtime polymorphism**.  \r\n- Always highlight **covariant return types** and **exception rules** when explaining overriding.  \r\n",

    "content": "\r\n## ✅ Short Answer\r\nThe `equals()` method of the `String` class **compares the contents (sequence of characters)** of two strings for equality.  \r\nIt does **not** check whether both references point to the same object — that is done by the `==` operator.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🔎 Explanation\r\n\r\n### 1. `==` Operator\r\n- Compares **object references**, i.e., whether two variables point to the same memory location.\r\n- Example:\r\n  ```java\r\n  String s1 = \"hello\";\r\n  String s2 = \"hello\";\r\n  String s3 = new String(\"hello\");\r\n\r\n  System.out.println(s1 == s2); // true (both refer to String Pool object)\r\n  System.out.println(s1 == s3); // false (s3 is a new object in heap)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. `equals()` Method\r\n- Overridden in the `String` class to compare **character sequences**.\r\n- Example:\r\n  ```java\r\n  String s1 = \"hello\";\r\n  String s2 = new String(\"hello\");\r\n\r\n  System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true (content is the same)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📌 Why Was `equals()` Overridden in String?\r\n- In `Object` class, the default `equals()` compares **references (like `==`)**.  \r\n- Since strings are meant to represent **textual data**, comparing references is not meaningful.  \r\n- Thus, `String` overrides `equals()` to check **value equality**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📖 Example with Both Cases\r\n```java\r\npublic class EqualsTest {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        String s1 = \"Java\";\r\n        String s2 = \"Java\";\r\n        String s3 = new String(\"Java\");\r\n\r\n        // Using ==\r\n        System.out.println(s1 == s2);   // true (same reference from String Pool)\r\n        System.out.println(s1 == s3);   // false (different object)\r\n\r\n        // Using equals()\r\n        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true (same content)\r\n        System.out.println(s1.equals(s3)); // true (same content)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 👉 Interview Tip\r\nIf asked:  \r\n- \"`==` vs `equals()` in String?\"  \r\n  - **`==` checks references**.  \r\n  - **`equals()` checks content**.  \r\n- Always use `equals()` when you want to compare the **actual text** inside strings.  \r\n\r\n",

The answer is:\r\n\r\n> ✅ **The `final` keyword in Java is a non-access modifier used to restrict variables, methods, and classes.**\r\n\r\n## Usage of `final`\r\n\r\n1. **Final Variables**  \r\n   - If a variable is declared as `final`, its value **cannot be reassigned** after initialization.  \r\n   - For **primitive types**, the value itself cannot change.  \r\n   - For **object references**, the reference cannot point to a new object (but the object’s internal state can still be modified, unless the object is immutable).\r\n\r\n   ```java\r\n   final int x = 10;\r\n   // x = 20; // ❌ Compile-time error\r\n\r\n   final List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();\r\n   list.add(\"A\"); // ✅ Allowed (modifying object state)\r\n   // list = new ArrayList<>(); // ❌ Not allowed\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Final Methods**  \r\n   - A `final` method cannot be **overridden** by subclasses.  \r\n   - Useful when you want to prevent alteration of important logic.  \r\n\r\n   ```java\r\n   class Parent {\r\n       public final void show() {\r\n           System.out.println(\"Parent logic\");\r\n       }\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   class Child extends Parent {\r\n       // ❌ Not allowed\r\n       // public void show() { ... }\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Final Classes**  \r\n   - A `final` class cannot be **extended** (no subclass can inherit it).  \r\n   - Example: `java.lang.String` is a `final` class in Java.\r\n\r\n   ```java\r\n   final class Utility {\r\n       void helper() {\r\n           System.out.println(\"Helper method\");\r\n       }\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   // ❌ Not allowed\r\n   // class ExtendedUtility extends Utility { }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. **Final Parameters**  \r\n   - A method parameter declared as `final` cannot be reassigned within the method body.  \r\n\r\n   ```java\r\n   void process(final int value) {\r\n       // value = 20; // ❌ Not allowed\r\n       System.out.println(value);\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Key Point for Interviews\r\n\r\n- **Final variable** → value/reference cannot be reassigned.  \r\n- **Final method** → cannot be overridden.  \r\n- **Final class** → cannot be extended.  \r\n- **Final parameter** → cannot be reassigned inside method.  \r\n\r\nThis ensures **immutability**, **security**, and prevents **unintended modification** of code.  \r\n",

The answer is:\r\n\r\n✅ Choose an interface when you want to define a contract for unrelated classes, and choose an abstract class when you want to provide shared state or partial implementation.\r\n\r\n## When to Use an Abstract Class:\r\n\r\nWhen you want to provide default implementations for some methods while keeping others abstract.\r\n\r\nWhen subclasses need to share common state (fields).\r\n\r\nWhen new methods are expected to be added frequently — because you can provide a default implementation in the abstract class without breaking existing subclasses.\r\n\r\nExample: AbstractList in Java Collections Framework provides skeletal implementations that subclasses can reuse.\r\n\r\n## When to Use an Interface:\r\n\r\nWhen you want to define a contract that multiple, potentially unrelated, classes can implement.\r\n\r\nWhen you need multiple inheritance of type (since a class can implement multiple interfaces but extend only one class).\r\n\r\nWhen you are designing APIs that should be flexible and loosely coupled.\r\n\r\nExample: List, Set, and Queue interfaces define behaviors that can be implemented by many classes.\r\n\r\n## Java 8+ Consideration:\r\n\r\nFrom Java 8 onwards, interfaces can have default and static methods, which makes them slightly closer to abstract classes.

    "content": "\r\n## Overview\r\nThe `finally` block in Java is designed to **always execute** after the `try` and `catch` blocks, regardless of whether an exception occurs.  \r\nIt is typically used for **resource cleanup** (closing files, database connections, releasing locks, etc.).\r\n\r\nHowever, there are certain **special cases** where the `finally` block will **not execute**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Cases When `finally` Does Not Execute\r\n\r\n### 1. When the JVM Terminates Abruptly\r\nIf the JVM shuts down or exits before the `finally` block executes, it won’t run.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class FinallyExample {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        try {\r\n            System.out.println(\"Inside try block\");\r\n            System.exit(0);  // Terminates JVM\r\n        } finally {\r\n            System.out.println(\"Finally block\"); // ❌ Not executed\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Reason:** `System.exit(0)` halts the JVM immediately.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. When the Thread is Killed/Interrupted Forcefully\r\nIf a thread running the `try-finally` block is killed (e.g., via `Thread.stop()` — deprecated), the `finally` block may not run.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3. When a Fatal Error Occurs\r\nFor example, **OutOfMemoryError** or **StackOverflowError** may prevent execution of `finally`.\r\n\r\n```java\r\ntry {\r\n    int[] arr = new int[Integer.MAX_VALUE]; // Causes OutOfMemoryError\r\n} finally {\r\n    System.out.println(\"Cleanup code\"); // ❌ May not run\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 4. When JVM Crashes\r\nAny **native crash** (e.g., due to native code or external library failure) may prevent `finally` from executing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Normal Execution Example\r\nIn normal cases (even with `return` or exceptions), the `finally` block **does execute**:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class NormalFinally {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        System.out.println(test());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static int test() {\r\n        try {\r\n            return 1;\r\n        } finally {\r\n            System.out.println(\"Finally executed!\"); // ✅ Will run\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\nFinally executed!\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n| Case | Will `finally` execute? |\r\n|------|--------------------------|\r\n| Normal execution | ✅ Yes |\r\n| With `return` statement | ✅ Yes |\r\n| With exception thrown | ✅ Yes (after catch or directly) |\r\n| `System.exit(0)` | ❌ No |\r\n| JVM crash | ❌ No |\r\n| Fatal errors (`OutOfMemoryError`, `StackOverflowError`) | ❌ No guarantee |\r\n| Thread killed | ❌ No guarantee |\r\n\r\n✅ **Key Point:** The `finally` block is *almost always* executed, except in cases where the JVM itself is terminated abnormally.\r\n\r\n",

If `a.equals(b) == true` → then `a.hashCode() == b.hashCode()` must also be true.  \r\n2. If `a.equals(b) == false` → hashCodes *may* still be the same (hash collision possible).  \r\n3. If you override one, **always override both**.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 👉 Interview Tip\r\n- If asked \"Why must we override both?\", say:  \r\n  > \"Because `HashMap` and `HashSet` first use `hashCode()` to find the bucket, then use `equals()` to resolve collisions. Overriding only one breaks this logic.\"  \r\n\r\n",

The answer is:\r\n\r\n✅ Default methods were introduced in Java 8 to allow interfaces to evolve without breaking existing implementations.\r\n\r\n## Why Were Default Methods Introduced?\r\n\r\nBefore Java 8, all interface methods were abstract.\r\n\r\nIf you added a new method to an interface, every implementing class (possibly hundreds of them) would break because they had to implement the new method.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, Java 8 introduced default methods where you can provide a method body directly in the interface.\r\n\r\nThis means existing classes can continue working unchanged, while still gaining new functionality if they want.\r\n\r\n## Key Benefits:\r\n\r\nAllows backward compatibility of interfaces.\r\n\r\nProvides default implementation so implementing classes are not forced to override.\r\n\r\nClasses can still override default methods if they want to customize behavior.\r\n\r\n```\r\nExample:\r\ninterface Vehicle {\r\n    void drive();\r\n\r\n    default void honk() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Default honk: Beep beep!\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Car implements Vehicle {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void drive() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Car is driving...\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Vehicle v = new Car();\r\n        v.drive();\r\n        v.honk(); // uses default implementation\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\nCar is driving...\r\nDefault honk: Beep beep!\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The Diamond Problem Scenario:\r\n\r\nIf a class implements two interfaces with the same default method, Java forces you to resolve the conflict:\r\n\r\ninterface Interface1 {\r\n    default void hello() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hello from Interface1\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface Interface2 {\r\n    default void hello() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hello from Interface2\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass MyClass implements Interface1, Interface2 {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void hello() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hello from MyClass (resolving conflict)\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\nHello from MyClass (resolving conflict)\r\n\r\nImportant Point for Interviews:\r\n\r\nDefault methods were introduced for backward compatibility, not as a replacement for abstract classes.\r\n\r\nIf two interfaces have the same default method, the implementing class must override it to resolve ambiguity (avoiding the Diamond Problem).\r\n\r\nThus, Java 8 default methods strike a balance between flexibility and backward compatibility while still maintaining clarity in multiple inheritance scenarios.\r\n",

The answer is:\r\n\r\n> ✅ **Java does not allow multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity and complexity (commonly known as the Diamond Problem).**\r\n\r\n## What is Multiple Inheritance?\r\n\r\n- Multiple inheritance occurs when a class tries to extend **more than one parent class**.  \r\n- Example (hypothetical, not allowed in Java):\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Parent1 {\r\n    void hello() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hello from Parent1\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Parent2 {\r\n    void hello() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hello from Parent2\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ❌ Not allowed in Java\r\nclass Child extends Parent1, Parent2 { }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Why is it Not Allowed?\r\n\r\n- If both parent classes have a method with the **same signature** (e.g., `hello()`), and the child inherits from both, **which method should the child call?**  \r\n- This leads to **ambiguity** and is referred to as the **Diamond Problem**.  \r\n- To keep the language **simple, clear, and less error-prone**, Java designers disallowed multiple class inheritance.\r\n\r\n## How Does Java Handle It Instead?\r\n\r\n- Java allows a class to **extend only one class** (abstract or concrete).  \r\n- To achieve multiple inheritance of type (behavior), Java uses **interfaces**.  \r\n- Since **Java 8**, interfaces can have `default` methods, but if a class implements two interfaces with the same default method, the compiler forces the developer to **override** it, thereby resolving the ambiguity explicitly.\r\n\r\n## Example with Interfaces (Allowed):\r\n\r\n```java\r\ninterface Interface1 {\r\n    default void hello() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hello from Interface1\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface Interface2 {\r\n    default void hello() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hello from Interface2\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Child implements Interface1, Interface2 {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void hello() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hello from Child (resolving ambiguity)\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHello from Child (resolving ambiguity)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Key Point for Interviews:\r\n\r\n- Java avoids **multiple class inheritance** to prevent ambiguity.  \r\n- Instead, Java uses **interfaces** to achieve similar flexibility, with explicit rules to resolve conflicts.  \r\n- This keeps the language **simple, safe, and predictable**.\r\n",

Any modification results in a **new String object** being created.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🔎 Reasons Why String is Immutable\r\n\r\n### 1. **Security**\r\n- Strings are heavily used in **network connections, database URLs, usernames, and passwords**.\r\n- If `String` were mutable, a hacker could change the value of a connection string after it was created, leading to **security vulnerabilities**.\r\n- Example:\r\n  ```java\r\n  String url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb\";\r\n  // Imagine if someone could modify \"mydb\" to \"hackedDB\"\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. **Caching and String Pool**\r\n- Java maintains a **String Constant Pool** (SCP).\r\n- Immutable strings allow safe sharing of objects in the pool.\r\n- Example:\r\n  ```java\r\n  String a = \"hello\";\r\n  String b = \"hello\";   // points to the same object in SCP\r\n  ```\r\n- If strings were mutable, changing `a` would also change `b`, breaking pooling.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3. **Thread-Safety**\r\n- Immutability makes `String` **inherently thread-safe**.\r\n- Multiple threads can share the same string without synchronization, avoiding race conditions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 4. **HashCode Caching**\r\n- Strings are commonly used as **keys in HashMap, HashSet, Hashtable**.\r\n- Since they are immutable:\r\n  - The hashcode of a String is computed only once.\r\n  - Performance is improved because repeated lookups don’t need re-computation.\r\n- If strings were mutable, a key’s value could change after insertion, making lookups unreliable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 5. **Performance Optimizations**\r\n- Because of immutability, JVM can **intern strings** and reuse them.\r\n- This reduces **memory footprint** and improves efficiency.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📌 Example Demonstration\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class StringTest {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        String s1 = \"hello\";\r\n        String s2 = s1;\r\n\r\n        s1 = s1 + \" world\"; // creates a new String object\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(s1); // hello world\r\n        System.out.println(s2); // hello\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Explanation**:  \r\n- `s1` initially points to `\"hello\"`.  \r\n- After concatenation, a **new String object** `\"hello world\"` is created.  \r\n- `s2` remains unchanged, proving immutability.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 👉 Interview Tip\r\nIf asked:  \r\n- \"Why is String immutable?\" → Mention **security, caching, thread-safety, and performance**.  \r\n- If pressed further → Talk about **string pool and hashcode caching**, which rely on immutability.  \r\n\r\n",

However, these differences become especially important when dealing with **components**, **event handlers**, and **state updates**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## ✅ Function Expression\r\n\r\nA **function expression** defines a function using the `function` keyword and can have its own `this` context.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst MyButton = function(props) {\r\n  return <button>{props.label}</button>;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Characteristics:\r\n- Has its own **`this` binding** (depends on how it is called).  \r\n- Can use the `arguments` object.  \r\n- Slightly more verbose syntax.  \r\n- In React, if used as a component, it behaves like a **regular functional component**.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## ✅ Arrow Function\r\n\r\nAn **arrow function** uses `=>` syntax and does **not** have its own `this`. Instead, it **lexically binds `this`** from the surrounding scope.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst MyButton = (props) => {\r\n  return <button>{props.label}</button>;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Characteristics:\r\n- **No own `this`** — inherits from the enclosing scope.  \r\n- Cannot use the `arguments` object (use rest parameters instead).  \r\n- More concise syntax, especially good for inline callbacks.  \r\n- Commonly used in React for:\r\n  - **Functional components** (preferred style).\r\n  - **Event handlers**: avoids manually binding `this` in class components.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🔑 Key Differences in ReactJS Context\r\n\r\n| Aspect                   | Function Expression                               | Arrow Function                                    |\r\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\r\n| **Syntax**                | Uses `function` keyword                          | Uses `=>` arrow syntax                           |\r\n| **`this` binding**        | Dynamic, depends on call site                    | Lexical, inherits from surrounding scope         |\r\n| **Use in class components** | May require `this.method = this.method.bind(this)` | No need to bind, `this` is automatically inherited |\r\n| **Use in functional components** | Works fine                                 | Preferred, more concise and modern                |\r\n| **Arguments object**      | Has its own `arguments`                          | Does not have `arguments`                        |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📌 Example: Event Handler in Class Component\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nclass Counter extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    super();\r\n    this.state = { count: 0 };\r\n\r\n    // Binding needed for function expression\r\n    this.incrementFn = this.incrementFn.bind(this);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Function Expression\r\n  incrementFn() {\r\n    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Arrow Function (no binding needed)\r\n  incrementArrow = () => {\r\n    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <button onClick={this.incrementFn}>Function Expression</button>\r\n        <button onClick={this.incrementArrow}>Arrow Function</button>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 👉 Interview Tip\r\n\r\n- **Arrow functions** are usually preferred in React for **inline callbacks** and **functional components** because they avoid boilerplate and `this` binding issues.  \r\n- However, **function expressions** (or declarations) are still perfectly valid and sometimes better for **named functions** when debugging stack traces.  \r\n\r\n",

Over the years, the approach has evolved from **XML-based configuration** to **annotation-based configuration**, and now to **Spring Boot auto-configuration**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## ✅ 1. XML-based Configuration (Legacy Approach)\r\n\r\nIn early versions of Spring, XML files were used to declare beans and their dependencies.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n```xml\r\n<beans xmlns=\"http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans\"\r\n       xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\r\n       xsi:schemaLocation=\"\r\n       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans\r\n       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd\">\r\n\r\n    <bean id=\"userService\" class=\"com.example.UserService\"/>\r\n    <bean id=\"orderService\" class=\"com.example.OrderService\">\r\n        <property name=\"userService\" ref=\"userService\"/>\r\n    </bean>\r\n</beans>\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Developers had to maintain large XML files.\r\n- This approach is rarely used in modern applications.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## ✅ 2. Annotation-based Configuration (Modern Standard)\r\n\r\nSpring introduced annotations to reduce boilerplate XML.\r\n\r\n**Common Annotations:**\r\n- `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller` → Define beans.\r\n- `@Autowired` → Inject dependencies.\r\n- `@Configuration` and `@Bean` → Define beans programmatically.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n```java\r\n@Configuration\r\npublic class AppConfig {\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public UserService userService() {\r\n        return new UserService();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public OrderService orderService(UserService userService) {\r\n        return new OrderService(userService);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Cleaner and type-safe compared to XML.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##\r\n",

    "content": "\r\nThis is a commonly asked interview question in Java and Spring-related interviews. The answer is:\r\n\r\n> ✅ **Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where an object’s dependencies are supplied by an external entity rather than the object creating them itself.**\r\n\r\n## Why is Dependency Injection Needed?\r\n\r\n- In traditional object-oriented programming, classes create and manage their own dependencies using `new`.  \r\n- This leads to **tight coupling** between classes, making code:  \r\n  - Harder to test (difficult to replace real dependencies with mocks).  \r\n  - Less flexible (changing a dependency impacts multiple classes).  \r\n  - More difficult to maintain.  \r\n\r\nDI solves this by **injecting dependencies from outside** (via constructors, setters, or interfaces).  \r\n\r\n## Types of Dependency Injection\r\n\r\n1. **Constructor Injection**  \r\n   - Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.  \r\n   - Promotes immutability (dependencies cannot be changed after construction).  \r\n\r\n2. **Setter Injection**  \r\n   - Dependencies are assigned through public setters.  \r\n   - Provides flexibility but allows modification after object creation.  \r\n\r\n3. **Interface Injection** (less common in Java)  \r\n   - Dependency is passed via an interface method.  \r\n\r\n## Example Without DI (Tightly Coupled)\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass ServiceA {\r\n    void doSomething() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Service A logic\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass ServiceB {\r\n    private ServiceA serviceA = new ServiceA(); // ❌ Tightly coupled\r\n\r\n    public void execute() {\r\n        serviceA.doSomething();\r\n        System.out.println(\"Service B logic\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Here, `ServiceB` is responsible for **creating** `ServiceA`.  \r\n- If `ServiceA` changes, `ServiceB` must also change.  \r\n\r\n## Example With DI (Loosely Coupled)\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass ServiceA {\r\n    void doSomething() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Service A logic\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass ServiceB {\r\n    private final ServiceA serviceA;\r\n\r\n    // ✅ Dependency is injected via constructor\r\n    public ServiceB(ServiceA serviceA) {\r\n        this.serviceA = serviceA;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void execute() {\r\n        serviceA.doSomething();\r\n        System.out.println(\"Service B logic\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Now `ServiceB` does not create `ServiceA` itself.  \r\n- The dependency is passed externally, making `ServiceB` **testable** and **loosely coupled**.  \r\n\r\n## In Spring Framework\r\n\r\nSpring provides a **Dependency Injection container**:  \r\n- Objects (beans) are defined and managed in the container.  \r\n- Dependencies are automatically **wired** at runtime using annotations like `@Autowired`, `@Inject`, or explicit configuration.  \r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Component\r\nclass ServiceA {\r\n    void doSomething() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Service A logic\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component\r\nclass ServiceB {\r\n    private final ServiceA serviceA;\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    public ServiceB(ServiceA serviceA) {\r\n        this.serviceA = serviceA;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void execute() {\r\n        serviceA.doSomething();\r\n        System.out.println(\"Service B logic\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Key Point for Interviews\r\n\r\n- Dependency Injection = **“Don’t call me, I’ll call you”** (Hollywood Principle).  \r\n- It helps achieve **loose coupling**, **testability**, and **flexibility**.  \r\n- Widely used in frameworks like **Spring**, **Guice**, and **Jakarta EE**.  \r\n",

    "content": "\r\n## What is Inversion of Control (IoC)?\r\n\r\n**Inversion of Control (IoC)** is a design principle where the responsibility of **creating objects, managing their lifecycle, and injecting dependencies** is shifted from the application code to a framework or container.\r\n\r\n- Traditionally, developers used the `new` keyword to create objects and wire dependencies manually.  \r\n- With IoC, this **control is inverted**: the framework manages object creation, dependency wiring, and lifecycle.  \r\n- In the Spring Framework, IoC is primarily achieved through **Dependency Injection (DI)**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## How Spring Supports IoC\r\n\r\nSpring provides an **IoC container** (e.g., `ApplicationContext`) that manages beans (objects).\r\n\r\n### Steps:\r\n1. Define components (beans) and their dependencies.  \r\n2. Configure them in:\r\n   - **XML configuration**, or\r\n   - **Annotations** (e.g., `@Component`, `@Autowired`), or\r\n   - **Java-based configuration** (`@Configuration`, `@Bean`).  \r\n3. The container creates, wires, and manages beans at runtime.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Example with XML Configuration\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<bean id=\"createNewStock\"\r\n      class=\"springexample.stockMarket.CreateNewStockAccount\">\r\n    <property name=\"newBid\" ref=\"bidService\"/>\r\n</bean>\r\n\r\n<bean id=\"bidService\"\r\n      class=\"springexample.stockMarket.BidService\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class CreateNewStockAccount {\r\n    private BidService newBid;\r\n\r\n    // Getter & Setter\r\n    public void setNewBid(BidService newBid) {\r\n        this.newBid = newBid;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Spring automatically **creates `BidService`** and injects it into `CreateNewStockAccount`.  \r\n- No `new` keyword needed in the developer’s code.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Example with Annotations (Preferred in Modern Spring)\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Component\r\npublic class BidService { }\r\n\r\n@Component\r\npublic class CreateNewStockAccount {\r\n    private final BidService bidService;\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    public CreateNewStockAccount(BidService bidService) {\r\n        this.bidService = bidService;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `@Component` marks classes as beans.  \r\n- `@Autowired` tells Spring to inject the dependency automatically.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 👉 Interview Tip\r\n\r\n- IoC is the **general principle**.  \r\n- **Dependency Injection (DI)** is the mechanism Spring uses to achieve IoC.  \r\n- Emphasize that IoC improves **loose coupling, testability, and modularity** of applications.  \r\n\r\n",

    "content": "\r\nThis is a fundamental interview question about the Spring ecosystem. The answer is:\r\n\r\n> ✅ **Spring is a powerful, lightweight framework that simplifies Java application development by providing infrastructure support such as Dependency Injection, Inversion of Control (IoC), and a modular architecture.**\r\n\r\n## What is the Spring Framework?\r\n\r\n- Spring is an **open-source framework** primarily for building enterprise-level Java applications.  \r\n- It provides a **comprehensive programming and configuration model**.  \r\n- Core features:\r\n  - **Dependency Injection (DI)** and **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: removes tight coupling between components.\r\n  - **Spring MVC**: supports web applications using a Model-View-Controller architecture.\r\n  - **Integration**: works seamlessly with other Java EE technologies (JPA, JMS, JDBC, etc.).\r\n  - **AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)**: helps with cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transactions.\r\n\r\n## Why Should Java Programmers Use Spring?\r\n\r\n- **Most popular Java framework**: Widely adopted across the industry; knowledge of Spring is expected in most Java developer roles.  \r\n- **Reduces boilerplate code**: Handles repetitive infrastructure concerns, so developers can focus on business logic.  \r\n- **Modular**: You can use only what you need (e.g., Spring Core, Spring MVC, Spring Data).  \r\n- **Integration with Spring Boot**: Provides production-ready defaults, embedded servers, and simplifies microservices development.  \r\n- **Community & Ecosystem**: Strong documentation, active community, and a huge ecosystem of projects (Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Cloud, etc.).  \r\n\r\n## Example: Dependency Injection in Spring\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Component\r\nclass ServiceA {\r\n    void doSomething() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Service A logic\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component\r\nclass ServiceB {\r\n    private final ServiceA serviceA;\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    public ServiceB(ServiceA serviceA) {\r\n        this.serviceA = serviceA;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void execute() {\r\n        serviceA.doSomething();\r\n        System.out.println(\"Service B logic\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Spring automatically **injects ServiceA into ServiceB** via the `@Autowired` constructor.  \r\n- This eliminates the need to manually instantiate objects, reducing coupling.  \r\n\r\n## Key Point for Interviews\r\n\r\n- Spring provides the **plumbing** (IoC, DI, AOP, MVC) so that developers can focus on **business logic**.  \r\n- It has become the **standard framework** for modern Java server-side development.  \r\n- With **Spring Boot**, it accelerates microservices and cloud-native applications.  \r\n",
