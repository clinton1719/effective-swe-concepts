What I liked about this achievement was not just the technical solution, but the direct business impact.\r\n\r\nAnother highlight was when I designed and implemented a custom load testing service using Helidon, AWS ECS, Lambda, and SQS in a serverless, event-driven architecture. This gave the team an automated way to stress-test our applications, improving reliability and scalability before releases. It was a chance to think end-to-end and architect a system, not just code it.\r\n\r\nI’m also particularly proud of a cost optimization initiative where I identified redundant AWS KMS keys and consolidated them, which cut cloud costs by around 60%. I didn’t just execute the fix — I presented my analysis to stakeholders and got buy-in, which built my confidence in driving technical decisions at a larger scale.\r\n\r\nEarlier in my career at TCS, working with ICICI Prudential as a client, I delivered over 140 requirements including several microservices, and even helped migrate legacy systems to AWS. That experience gave me both technical grounding and exposure to how large-scale financial systems operate.\r\n\r\nAcross both roles, what I’m proud of is not just delivering code, but finding ways to make systems faster, cheaper, and more reliable, while also contributing to team knowledge-sharing.\r\n\r\n",

The constructor helps to **initialize data members** defined in the abstract class.\r\n\r\n### Important Concepts:\r\n\r\n- Constructors are used to initialize instance variables.\r\n- An abstract class **can have instance variables** (just like any class).\r\n- When a subclass extends an abstract class and is instantiated, the **abstract class constructor is executed first** via an implicit or explicit `super()` call.\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nabstract class Vehicle {\r\n    String type;\r\n\r\n    Vehicle(String type) {\r\n        this.type = type;\r\n        System.out.println(\"Vehicle constructor called: \" + type);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Car extends Vehicle {\r\n    Car() {\r\n        super(\"Car\");\r\n        System.out.println(\"Car constructor called\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Car c = new Car();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nVehicle constructor called: Car\r\nCar constructor called\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs shown above:\r\n- The abstract class `Vehicle` has a constructor.\r\n- When `Car` is instantiated, `Vehicle`'s constructor is called first using `super(\"Car\")`.\r\n\r\nThis demonstrates that **abstract class constructors participate in the object initialization chain**, just like constructors in concrete superclasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "content": "\r\nThe four fundamental pillars of OOP are:\r\n\r\n1. **Abstraction**  \r\n2. **Encapsulation**  \r\n3. **Inheritance**  \r\n4. **Polymorphism**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 1. Abstraction\r\n\r\n**Definition**: Abstraction is the process of hiding internal implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user.\r\n\r\n**Real-world examples**:\r\n- **TV Remote**: To turn on the TV, you press the power button — you don’t need to know how the internal circuits work or how infrared signals are transmitted.\r\n- **Car Gear**: You know what happens when you change gears, but the underlying mechanism is hidden from you. That technical detail is abstracted.\r\n\r\n**In Java**, abstraction can be achieved in two ways:\r\n- Using **abstract classes**\r\n- Using **interfaces**\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Abstract class example\r\nabstract class Animal {\r\n    abstract void makeSound();\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Dog extends Animal {\r\n    void makeSound() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Bark\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. Encapsulation\r\n\r\n**Definition**: Encapsulation is the process of binding data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit — typically a class. It is also used to restrict access to internal details using access modifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`).\r\n\r\nEncapsulation supports **data hiding** and helps in achieving **abstraction**.\r\n\r\n**Example**:  \r\nA Java Bean where all data members are private and are accessed via public getters/setters.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Person {\r\n    private String name;\r\n\r\n    public String getName() {\r\n        return name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setName(String name) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3. Inheritance\r\n\r\n**Definition**: Inheritance allows one class (child/subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent/superclass). This promotes **code reusability** and establishes a **parent-child relationship** between classes.\r\n\r\n> Java supports single inheritance through classes and multiple inheritance through interfaces.\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n```java\r\nclass Animal {\r\n    void eat() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"This animal eats food\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Dog extends Animal {\r\n    void bark() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"The dog barks\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 4. Polymorphism\r\n\r\n**Definition**: \"Poly\" means many, and \"morph\" means forms. Polymorphism allows objects or methods to take multiple forms.\r\n\r\nThere are **two types of polymorphism**:\r\n\r\n#### a) Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)\r\nOccurs when multiple methods have the same name but different parameters in the same class. The method to call is decided at **compile-time**.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass MathUtils {\r\n    int add(int a, int b) {\r\n        return a + b;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    double add(double a, double b) {\r\n        return a + b;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### b) Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)\r\nOccurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass. The method to call is determined at **runtime**.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Animal {\r\n    void sound() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Animal makes sound\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Cat extends Animal {\r\n    void sound() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Cat meows\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Summary Table\r\n\r\n| Pillar        | Key Concept                            | Java Support                         |\r\n|---------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\r\n| Abstraction   | Hide internal details, show only needed| Abstract classes, Interfaces         |\r\n| Encapsulation | Bind data & methods, restrict access   | Classes, Access Modifiers            |\r\n| Inheritance   | Reuse code via parent-child classes    | `extends`, Interfaces (`implements`) |\r\n| Polymorphism  | One name, many forms                   | Overloading & Overriding             |\r\n\r\n",
